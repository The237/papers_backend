Incidence of cancer in postmyocardial infarction patients treated with short-acting nifedipine and diltiazem. Secondary Prevention Group.,"Recent reports suggest a possible link between nifedipine (but not diltiazem) and an increased risk of cancer in patients being treated with calcium antagonists. A total of 1054 postmyocardial infarction patients were divided randomly into those being treated with calcium antagonists (n = 566 [nifedipine, 425 patients and diltiazem, 141 patients]) and controls (no calcium antagonist; n = 488). The patients were followed for 26.3 months, and the incidences of cardiac events as well as cancer were compared among the 3 groups. Thirteen patients (2.7%) in the control group developed cancer, whereas 15 patients in the nifedipine group (3.5%; odds ratio, 1.34; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 0.63-2.85) and 3 patients in the diltiazem group (2.1%; odds ratio, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.27-2.93) developed cancer. Diltiazem appears to present no increased risk of cancer. The incidence of cancer was slightly higher in the patients receiving nifedipine than in those not being treated with a calcium antagonist, which is consistent with earlier reports; however, this increase was not statistically significant."
Physical Symptoms Distress Index: a sensitive tool to evaluate the impact of pharmacological agents on quality of life.,"To examine whether the degree of stress associated with adverse physical side effects correlates with overall quality of life (QOL) and compliance rates. To determine if instruments used to assess QOL can detect differences between treatments that have no known central nervous system effects. This randomized, double-blind, parallel group study evaluated 180 to 480 mg of controlled onset, extended release (COER)-verapamil (n = 259) or 30 to 120 mg/d of nifedipine gastrointestinal therapeutic system (GITS) (n = 269) in men and women between 21 and 80 years of age with stages 1 to 3 hypertension. A battery of questions evaluating psychological well-being and a physical symptom distress index was administered after a 4-week placebo washout (baseline) and after 10 weeks of treatment or at dropout. Both treatments effectively lowered blood pressure, and there were no significant between-group differences in psychosocial QOL. A difference in the level of physical symptom distress was detected between treatments (P = .002; multivariate analysis of variance), with 7 significant univariate treatment effects, all favoring COER-verapamil, being noted-pedal edema, polyuria, rapid heart beat or palpitations, hives, muscle cramps, abdominal cramps, and headaches. Constipation-related distress increased significantly (P = .001) but to a similar extent with both treatments. The difference in symptom distress tended to predict compliance as there were more withdrawals in the nifedipine GITS group (n = 85) vs COER-verapamil group (n = 64) (P = .08). Patient-assessed physical symptom distress is a sensitive, simple technique to evaluate the effect of antihypertensive medications on QOL and tolerability, as shown by its ability to detect the improvement associated with COER-verapamil. Depending on the agents involved, the Physical Symptom Distress Index may more closely predict dropout rates than the traditional psychosocial instruments, as suggested by the lower dropout rate in the COER-verapamil group. Thus, in studying treatment effects on QOL, both the distress of physical symptoms and the impact of psychosocial factors should be evaluated."
Effects of long-acting versus short-acting calcium channel blockers among older survivors of acute myocardial infarction.,"Recent studies have highlighted the potentially harmful effects of short-acting calcium channel blockers, especially of the dihydropyridine type, in patients with coronary heart disease. Some have argued that long-acting calcium channel blockers are safer, but few outcome data exist. The objective of the study was to compare the occurrence of adverse outcomes among recipients of long-acting versus short-acting calcium channel blockers, with dihydropyridines and non-dihydropyridines compared separately. The New Jersey Medicare population. A retrospective cohort study using linked Medicare and drug claims data. Older survivors of acute myocardial infarction (MI) occurring in 1989 and 1990. Eligible subjects had survived at least 30 days after the MI, participated in Medicare and a drug benefits program, and were prescribed a single type of either a long-acting or a short-acting calcium channel blocker within 90 days after the MI. The two outcome measures were rates of all-cause mortality and cardiac rehospitalization. Using separate Cox regression models for dihydropyridines (nifedipine, nicardipine) and non-dihydropyridines (diltiazem, verapamil), we examined these outcomes for recipients of long-acting compared with short-acting calcium channel blockers. Of the 833 patients eligible for the study, 160 were prescribed long-acting and 673 short-acting calcium channel blockers. Clinical characteristics of long-acting and short-acting users were comparable. During 2 years of follow-up, 221 deaths and 300 rehospitalizations occurred. Controlling for age, sex, race, and indicators of disease severity and comorbidity, the relative risk of dying for recipients of long-acting, compared with short-acting, dihydropyridines was .42 (95% confidence interval (CI), 0.21-0.86). For cardiac rehospitalization, the relative risk was 0.57 (95% CI, 0.34-0.94). For the long-acting versus short-acting nondihydropyridines, the adjusted relative risk of dying was 1.43 (95% CI, 0.88-2.32), and for cardiac rehospitalization, .65 (95% CI, 0.40-1.05). Use of long-acting dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers after acute MI was associated with substantially lower rates of cardiac rehospitalization and death compared with use of their short-acting counterparts. More data are needed to address the possibility that long-acting, compared with short-acting, non-dihydropyridines could decrease rehospitalization rates but increase mortality."
"Cohort study on calcium channel blockers, other cardiovascular agents, and the prevalence of depression.","Some reports have suggested that calcium channel blockers may be associated with an increased incidence of depression or suicide. There is a paucity of evidence from large scale studies. The aim of this study was to assess rates of depression with calcium channel antagonists using data from prescription event monitoring studies. Observational studies on large cohorts of patients using lisinopril, enalapril (ACE inhibitors), nicardipine (type 2 calcium channel blocker) and diltiazem (type 3 calcium channel blocker) were conducted, using prescription-event monitoring. Rates of depression in the different drugs and rate ratios (95% CI) were computed. The crude overall rates of depression during treatment were 1.89, 1.92 and 1.62 per 1000 patient months for the ACE inhibitors, diltiazem and nicardipine, respectively. Using the ACE inhibitors as the reference group, the rate ratios for depression were 1.07 (0. 82-1.40) and 0.86 (0.69-1.08) for diltiazem and nicardipine, respectively. This study does not support the hypothesis that calcium channel blockers are associated with depression, when considering patients treated in general practice in the UK."
Calcium channel blockers and mortality in elderly patients with myocardial infarction.,"Although calcium channel blockers are a useful therapy in relieving angina, lowering blood pressure, and slowing conduction of atrial fibrillation, growing evidence has cast doubt on their safety in patients with coronary disease. To examine the association between calcium channel blocker therapy at hospital discharge and mortality in a population-based sample of elderly patients hospitalized with acute myocardial infarction. Retrospective cohort study using data from medical charts and administrative files. All acute care hospitals in 46 states. All Medicare patients with a principal diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction consecutively discharged from the hospital alive during 8-month periods between 1994 and 1995 (N = 141,041). Mortality at 30 days and 1 year. Calcium channel blockers were widely prescribed at hospital discharge to elderly patients with myocardial infarction between 1994 and 1995 (n = 51,921), the most commonly prescribed being diltiazem (n = 21,175), nifedipine (n = 12,670), amlodipine (n = 11,683), and verapamil (n = 3639). After adjusting for illness severity and concomitant medication use, patients who were prescribed calcium channel blockers at hospital discharge did not have increased risk for 30-day or 1-year mortality, with the exception of the few (n = 116) treated with bepridil. Bepridil differs from other calcium channel blockers because of its tendency to prolong repolarization, and its association with proarrhythmic effects in elderly patients. We did not identify a mortality risk in a large consecutive sample of elderly patients with myocardial infarction, which supports the need for additional prospective trials examining calcium channel blocker therapy for ischemic heart disease."
Randomized double-blind comparison of a calcium antagonist and a diuretic in elderly hypertensives. National Intervention Cooperative Study in Elderly Hypertensives Study Group.,"Although diuretics are recommended for the treatment of hypertension, decreased diuretic use and increased calcium antagonist use necessitate a comparison of the efficacy of these drugs in preventing cardiovascular events. Patients >/=60 years of age with systolic blood pressure of 160 to 220 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure <115 mm Hg were enrolled. Patients were randomly assigned to 20 mg of sustained-release nicardipine hydrochloride twice daily or 2 mg of trichlormethiazide once daily by the double-dummy method and followed up for 5 years. A total of 414 patients were analyzed: 204 in the nicardipine group and 210 in the diuretic group. Blood pressure at entry was 172/94 mm Hg and 173/93 mm Hg, respectively, and decreased to 147/81 mm Hg and 147/79 mm Hg, respectively. Cardiovascular morbidity rates per 1000 persons per year were similar in the nicardipine and diuretic groups (27.8 and 26.8, respectively; P=0.923). The sex- and age-adjusted risk ratio for the nicardipine group was 0.973 (95% confidence interval, 0.514 to 1.839, P=0.932). The calcium antagonist and diuretic groups had a similarly decreased rate of cardiovascular events."
Long-term effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition and metabolic control in hypertensive type 2 diabetic patients.,"Long-term effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition and metabolic control in hypertensive type 2 diabetic patients. In hypertensive type 2 diabetic patients, treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors is associated with a lower incidence of cardiovascular events than those treated with calcium channel-blocking agents. However, the long-term renal effects of ACE inhibitors in these patients remain inconclusive. In 1989, we commenced a placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized study to examine the anti-albuminuric effects of enalapril versus nifedipine (slow release) in 102 hypertensive, type 2 diabetic patients. These patients have been followed up for a mean trial duration of 5.5 +/- 2.2 years. We examined the determinants, including the effect of ACE inhibition on clinical outcomes in these patients. After a six-week placebo-controlled, run-in period, 52 patients were randomized double-blind to receive nifedipine (slow release) and 50 patients to receive enalapril. After the one-year analysis, which confirmed the superior anti-albuminuric effects of enalapril (-54%) over nifedipine (+11%), all patients were continued on their previously assigned treatment with informed consent. They were subdivided into normoalbuminuric (N = 43), microalbuminuric (N = 34), and macroalbuminuric (N = 25) groups based on two of three 24-hour urinary albumin excretion (UAE) measurements during the run-in period. Renal function was shown by the 24-hour UAE, creatinine clearance (CCr), and the regression coefficient of the yearly plasma creatinine reciprocal (beta-1/Cr). Clinical endpoints were defined as death, cardiovascular events, and/or renal events (need for renal replacement therapy or doubling of baseline plasma creatinine). In the whole group, patients treated with enalapril were more likely to revert to being normoalbuminuric (23.8 vs. 15.4%), and fewer of them developed macroalbuminuria (19.1 vs. 30.8%) compared with the nifedipine-treated patients (P < 0.05). In the microalbuminuric group, treatment with enalapril (N = 21) was associated with a 13.0% (P < 0.01) reduction in 24-hour UAE compared with a 17.3% increase in the nifedipine group (N = 13). In the macroalbuminuric patients, enalapril treatment (N = 11) was associated with stabilization compared with a decline in renal function in the nifedipine group, as shown by the beta-1/Cr (0.65 +/- 4.29 vs. -1.93 +/- 2.35 1/micromol x 10-3, P < 0.05) after adjustment for baseline values. Compared with the normoalbuminuric and microalbuminuric patients, those with macroalbuminuria had the lowest mean CCr (75.5 +/- 24.1 vs. 63.5 +/- 21.3 vs. 41.9 +/- 18.5 mL/min, P < 0.001) and the highest frequency of clinical events (4.7 vs. 5.9 vs. 52%, P < 0. 001). On multivariate analysis, beta-1/Cr (R2 = 0.195, P < 0.001) was independently associated with baseline HbA1c (beta = -0.285, P = 0.004), whereas clinical outcomes (R2 = 0.176, P < 0.001) were independently related to the mean low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (beta = 2.426, P = 0.018), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (beta = -8.797, P = 0.03), baseline UAE (beta = 0.002, P = 0.04), and mean CCr during treatment (beta = -0.211, P = 0.006). In this prospective cohort analysis involving 102 hypertensive, type 2 diabetic patients with varying degrees of albuminuria followed up for a mean duration of five years, we observed the importance of good metabolic and blood pressure control on the progression of albuminuria and renal function. Treatment with enalapril was associated with a greater reduction in albuminuria than with nifedipine in the entire patient group, and especially in those with microalbuminuria. In the macroalbuminuric patients, the rate of deterioration in renal function was also attenuated by treatment with enalapril."
Sex bias and underutilization of lipid-lowering therapy in patients with coronary artery disease at academic medical centers in the United States and Canada. Prospective Randomized Evaluation of the Vascular Effects of Norvasc Trial (PREVENT) Investigators.,"The efficacy of lipid-lowering therapy (LLT) has been well established for patients with preexisting coronary artery disease (CAD). However, limited information is available assessing the extent to which these medications are prescribed in academic medical centers. The use of LLT for patients with CAD was prospectively evaluated in 825 men and women who were recruited from 16 academic medical centers in the United States and Canada to participate in the Prospective Evaluation of the Vascular Events of Norvasc Trial (PREVENT). The assessment of LLT use during the 3-year trial was evaluated in patients receiving amlodipine therapy and placebo; levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) were used to assess the impact of LLT. Despite a baseline prevalence of LLT in 42% of men (38% in 1994), half of the patients had high levels of LDL-C (>3.36 mmol [>130 mg/dL]). During the subsequent 3 years, the prevalence of elevated LDL-C levels dropped in men (29%) but remained stagnant in women (48%). These changes were associated with increased LLT in men (55%) but not in women (35%) (P = .04). In 1994, the LDL-C target goal (<2.59 mmol/L [<100 mg/dL]) was attained in 17% of men and 6% of women (P = .006). At study completion in 1997, the LDL-C target goal was achieved in 31% of men and only 12% of women (P = .001). This study highlights the relatively low treatment rates of hyperlipidemia among patients with CAD overall and women in particular who were participating in a clinical trial at academic medical centers in the United States and Canada. Because LLT has been proven to reduce future cardiovascular events, these results suggest that more intensive efforts should be promoted in order to maximize CAD reduction."
"Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, calcium channel blockers, and breast cancer.","The use of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors has been linked to a decreased risk of developing cancer, and longer-term use of calcium channel blockers (CCBs) has been associated with an increased risk of developing cancer in general and breast cancer in particular. Using data from the General Practice Research Database, we conducted a large case-control analysis. Previous exposure to ACE inhibitors, CCBs, and beta-blockers was compared between 3706 postmenopausal women who were diagnosed with incident breast cancer between 1992 and 1997 and 14155 matched-control women. Compared with nonusers of antihypertensive drugs, women who used ACE inhibitors (odds ratio [OR], 1.0; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.7-1.5), CCBs (OR, 0.9; 95% CI, 0.7-1.2), or beta-blockers (OR, 1.0; 95% CI, 0.8-1.2) for 5 or more years were not at an increased or decreased risk of developing breast cancer (adjusted for smoking and body mass index [calculated as weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters]). The risk of breast cancer did not differ between users of different ACE inhibitors or different CCBs (dihydropyridines, diltiazem hydrochloride, and verapamil hydrochloride) or between users of short-acting (OR, 1.0; 95% CI, 0.7-1.4) or sustained-release (OR, 1.0; 95% CI, 0.8-1.3) nifedipine preparations. The findings of this large case-control analysis do not support the hypothesis that longer-term use of ACE inhibitors or CCBs affects the risk of developing breast cancer."
The evidence regarding the drugs used for ventricular rate control.,"Our goal was to determine what drugs are most efficacious for controlling the ventricular rate in patients with atrial fibrillation. We conducted a systematic review of the literature published before May 1998, beginning with searches of The Cochrane Collaboration's CENTRAL database and MEDLINE. We included English-language articles describing randomized controlled trials of drugs used for heart rate control in adults with atrial fibrillation. Abstracts of trials were reviewed independently by 2 members of the study team. We reviewed English-language abstracts of non-English-language publications to assess qualitative consistency with our results. Forty-five articles evaluating 17 drugs met our criteria for review. In the 5 trials of verapamil and 5 of diltiazem, heart rate was reduced significantly (P <.05), both at rest and with exercise, compared with placebo, with equivalent or improved exercise tolerance in 6 of 7 comparisons. In 7 of 12 comparisons of a beta-blocker with placebo, the beta-blocker was efficacious for control of resting heart rate, with evidence that the effect is drug specific, as nadolol and atenolol proved to be most efficacious. All 9 comparisons demonstrated good heart rate control with beta-blockers during exercise, although exercise tolerance was compromised in 3 of 9 comparisons. In 7 of 8 trials, digoxin administered alone slowed the resting heart rate more than placebo, but it did not significantly slow the rate during exercise in 4 studies. The trials evaluating other drugs yielded insufficient evidence to support their use, but those drugs may yet be promising. The calcium-channel blockers verapamil or diltiazem, or select beta-blockers are efficacious for heart rate control at rest and during exercise for patients with atrial fibrillation without a clinically important decrease in exercise tolerance. Digoxin is useful when rate control during exercise is less a concern."
"Effects of amlodipine on exercise tolerance, quality of life, and left ventricular function in patients with heart failure from left ventricular systolic dysfunction.","A preliminary study suggested that the long-acting late-generation calcium-channel blocker amlodipine has favorable effects on exercise tolerance and is safe to use in heart failure, in contrast to earlier generation agents. The goal of 2 multicenter studies was to assess the effect of adjunctive therapy with amlodipine in addition to standard therapy on exercise capacity, quality of life, left ventricular function, and safety parameters in patients with heart failure and left ventricular systolic dysfunction. Two large multicenter trials examining the effects of amlodipine on these parameters over a 12-week period of therapy were undertaken in patients with mild to moderate heart failure and left ventricular systolic dysfunction. A total of 437 patients with stable heart failure were studied in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled prospective design. Amlodipine at a dose of 10 mg/day in addition to standard therapy in such patients was associated with no significant difference in change in exercise tolerance on a Naughton protocol compared with placebo in each trial. Among all patients taking amlodipine, exercise time increased 53 +/- 9 (SE) seconds; exercise time for those taking placebo increased 66 +/- 9 seconds (P = not significant). There were no significant differences in changes of quality of life parameters between amlodipine- and placebo-treated patients, and there were no significant differences in symptom scores or New York Heart Association classification between groups. Left ventricular function (measured as ejection fraction) improved 3. 4% +/- 0.5% in amlodipine-treated patients and 1.5% +/- 0.5% in placebo-treated patients (P =.007). There was no statistically significant excess of important adverse events (episodes of worsening heart failure in 10% amlodipine-treated vs 6.3% of placebo-treated patients) or differences in need for changes in background medication between groups. The addition of 10 mg of amlodipine per day to standard therapy in patients with heart failure is associated with no significant improvement in exercise time compared with placebo therapy over a 12-week period, and there was no increased incidence of adverse events. These data suggest that the addition of amlodipine to standard therapy in heart failure will not result in additional efficacy per se beyond standard therapy."
Bisoprolol and nifedipine retard in elderly hypertensive patients: effect on quality of life.,"Subjects over the age 60 with sustained sitting diastolic pressures of 95-115 mm Hg were randomised to a regime based on bisoprolol (n = 368) or nifedipine retard (n = 379) for 24 weeks. The goal diastolic pressure was < or =90 mm Hg and to achieve this, double-blind medication could be doubled (5/10 mg bisoprolol, 40/80 mg nifedipine retard) or hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg (unblinded) could be added to the higher dose. In an intention-to-treat analysis, 309 subjects in both the bisoprolol and nifedipine retard treated group provided at least a baseline and a second quality of life assessment (82%). An excess of symptoms was observed in the nifedipine group for oedema of the legs, nocturia, constipation, racing heart and heart thumping. Fewer patients reported wheeze in the nifedipine group. For quality of life, there were no statistically significant differences between the two groups after 8 weeks. However, when analysing the results of the last available assessment (usually at 24 weeks) there were significant (P < 0.05) improvements in tension/anxiety, anger/ hostility, vigour/activity, and confusion/bewilderment, assessed by the Profile of Mood States (POMS) in patients receiving bisoprolol in comparison to those receiving nifedipine retard. The Sickness Impact Profile and objective tests of cognitive function did not differ statistically between the two groups. Quality of life was maintained at a good level on both treatments with advantages for bisoprolol in certain areas. Journal of Human Hypertension (2000) 14, 205-212."
Felodipine improves left ventricular emptying in patients with chronic heart failure: V-HeFT III echocardiographic substudy of multicenter reproducibility and detecting functional change.,"The echocardiographic substudy of the Vasodilator-Heart Failure Trial III (V-HeFT III) aimed to determine if felodipine treatment in patients with heart failure who were taking an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor had a favorable effect on left ventricular (LV) structure and function. Earlier V-HeFT trials showed that hydralazine-isosorbide dinitrate improved ejection fraction (EF) and survival, whereas enalapril achieved greater survival with smaller increases in EF. Would the combination of a potent vasodilator and enalapril produce greater improvements in function and survival? Doppler-echocardiographic data were collected from 260 males with heart failure who were randomized to felodipine or a placebo. Mean intrasubject differences between baseline, at 3 months, and at 12 months were compared. Intersite and intrareader reproducibilities were measured from duplicate recordings and readings. At 3 months, no changes in ultrasound variables from baseline occurred in either group. At 12 months, felodipine patients achieved greater increases in EF, shortening of LV end-systolic length, and increases in stroke volume index. Reproducibility coefficients of variation were 7.4% (EF), 6.0% (end-diastolic length), and 13.0% (stroke volume index). The echocardiographic substudy showed that felodipine, added to heart failure therapy, increased EF, shortened end-systolic length, and increased stroke volume index. The changes were small and confirmed that reproducibility from multiple laboratories can be coordinated into a useful research tool."
Progress report on the Nordic diltiazem study (NORDIL): an outcome study in hypertensive patients.,"NORDIL--the Nordic Diltiazem Study (NORDIL)--is a prospective, randomized, open blinded-endpoint (PROBE), multicenter, parallel-group morbidity/mortality outcome study in hypertensive patients designed to compare an intervention strategy based on the calcium antagonist diltiazem with a strategy based on conventional antihypertensive drug treatment (diuretics or beta-adrenergic blockers). Patient recruitment was started in Norway and Sweden in September 1992, and ended on December 15, 1996, when 10.896 male and female patients, aged 50-74 years, with essential hypertension had been randomized. In this paper we describe the baseline data of the patient cohort and blood pressures achieved in the two treatment groups during the early part of the study. The patient cohort consists of 5294 males and 5602 females with a mean age of 59.6 and 60.3 years, respectively. Concomitant disorders and risk factors in the cohort are: smoking 22%, ischemic heart disease 3.0%, previous myocardial infarction (MI) 2.0%, previous stroke 1.5%, diabetes mellitus 7.0%, and renal impairment 0.3%. There were no differences between the treatment groups in these respects. The blood pressure treatment goal is a target diastolic blood pressure of < or =90 mmHg or a 10% diastolic blood pressure reduction from the inclusion pressure. In the treatment group randomized to a diltiazem-based treatment strategy, blood pressure was 174/106 mmHg at baseline and 156/90 mmHg after 12 months of follow-up on active treatment. In the group randomized to a conventional treatment strategy, baseline blood pressure at randomization was 173/106 mmHg and 153/90 mmHg after 12 months on active therapy. The NORDIL study will terminate on October 31, 1999 and the final results should be available by mid-2000."
Plasma norepinephrine and atrial natriuretic peptide in heart failure: influence of felodipine in the third Vasodilator Heart Failure Trial. V-HeFT III investigators.,"Reflex activation of the sympathetic nervous system by short-acting dihydropyridine calcium channel antagonists has been reported to harm hypertensive patients. Different neurohormonal profiles and their response to treatment may influence the effectiveness of dihydropyridine vasodilator treatment of heart failure. Four hundred fifty men with left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction were administered standard heart failure treatment and felodipine extended release (ER) or placebo in the Vasodilator Heart Failure Trial III (V-HeFT III). Plasma norepinephrine (PNE) levels, atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) levels, exercise capacity, LV ejection fraction (EF), cardiac dimensions and function, and arrhythmia frequency were measured. Hospital-free survival for baseline neurohormonal classes was assessed. Distributions of ANP and PNE levels at baseline in patients with heart failure of ischemic and nonischemic causes were virtually identical. ANP levels at baseline were inversely related to LVEF (r = -0.39; P = .0001), exercise duration (r = -0.19; P = .0001), and peak oxygen consumption (r = -0.27; P = .008) and directly related to LV (r = 0.23; P = .0006) and right ventricular dilatation (r = 0.23; P = .0008). The increase in ANP levels between baseline and 3 months (P = .02) and 1 year (P = .03) was significantly less in the felodipine-ER group than in the placebo group, but PNE levels did not differ between treatment groups. Hospital-free survival was directly related to baseline ANP (P = .0002) and PNE levels (P = .004). All-cause mortality was related to baseline PNE levels (P = .02) but not baseline ANP levels. Levels of ANP and PNE hormones are related to LV dysfunction, exercise performance, and hospital-free survival in heart failure and PNE levels are related to all-cause mortality. Treatment with felodipine ER did not adversely affect survival in any neurohormone subclass."
Randomised trial of effects of calcium antagonists compared with diuretics and beta-blockers on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in hypertension: the Nordic Diltiazem (NORDIL) study.,"Calcium antagonists are a first-line treatment for hypertension. The effectiveness of diltiazem, a non-dihydropyridine calcium antagonist, in reducing cardiovascular morbidity or mortality is unclear. We compared the effects of diltiazem with that of diuretics, beta-blockers, or both on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in hypertensive patients. In a prospective, randomised, open, blinded endpoint study, we enrolled 10,881 patients, aged 50-74 years, at health centres in Norway and Sweden, who had diastolic blood pressure of 100 mm Hg or more. We randomly assigned patients diltiazem, or diuretics, beta-blockers, or both. The combined primary endpoint was fatal and non-fatal stroke, myocardial infarction, and other cardiovascular death. Analysis was done by intention to treat. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure were lowered effectively in the diltiazem and diuretic and beta-blocker groups (reduction 20.3/18.7 vs 23.3/18.7 mm Hg; difference in systolic reduction p<0.001). A primary endpoint occurred in 403 patients in the diltiazem group and in 400 in the diuretic and beta-blocker group (16.6 vs 16.2 events per 1000 patient-years; relative risk 1.00 [95% CI 0.87-1.15], p=0.97). Fatal and non-fatal stroke occurred in 159 patients in the diltiazem group and in 196 in the diuretic and beta-blocker group (6.4 vs 7.9 events per 1000 patient-years; 0.80 [0.65-0.99], p=0.04) and fatal and non-fatal myocardial infarction in 183 and 157 patients (7.4 vs 6.3 events per 1000 patient-years; 1.16 [0.94-1.44], p=0.17). Diltiazem was as effective as treatment based on diuretics, beta-blockers, or both in preventing the combined primary endpoint of all stroke, myocardial infarction, and other cardiovascular death."
Morbidity and mortality in patients randomised to double-blind treatment with a long-acting calcium-channel blocker or diuretic in the International Nifedipine GITS study: Intervention as a Goal in Hypertension Treatment (INSIGHT).,"The efficacy of antihypertensive drugs newer than diuretics and beta-blockers has not been established. We compared the effects of the calcium-channel blocker nifedipine once daily with the diuretic combination co-amilozide on cardiovascular mortality and morbidity in high-risk patients with hypertension. We did a prospective, randomised, double-blind trial in Europe and Israel in 6321 patients aged 55-80 years with hypertension (blood pressure > or = 150/95 mm Hg, or > or = 160 mm Hg systolic). Patients had at least one additional cardiovascular risk factor. We randomly assigned patients nifedipine 30 mg in a long-acting gastrointestinal-transport-system (GITS) formulation (n=3157), or co-amilozide (hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg [corrected] plus amiloride 2.5 mg; n=3164). Dose titration was by dose doubling, and addition of atenolol 25-50 mg or enalapril 5-10 mg. The primary outcome was cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, heart failure, or stroke. Analysis was done by intention to treat. Primary outcomes occurred in 200 (6.3%) patients in the nifedipine group and in 182 (5.8%) in the co-amilozide group (18.2 vs 16.5 events per 1000 patient-years; relative risk 1.10 [95% CI 0.91-1.34], p=0.35). Overall mean blood pressure fell from 173/99 mm Hg (SD 14/8) to 138/82 mm Hg (12/7). There was an 8% excess of withdrawals from the nifedipine group because of peripheral oedema (725 vs 518, p<0.0001), but serious adverse events were more frequent in the co-amilozide group (880 vs 796, p=0.02). Deaths were mainly non-vascular (nifedipine 176 vs co-amilozide 172; p=0.81). 80% of the primary events occurred in patients receiving randomised treatment (157 nifedipine, 147 co-amilozide, difference 0.33% [-0.7 to 1.4]). Nifedipine once daily and co-amilozide were equally effective in preventing overall cardiovascular or cerebrovascular complications. The choice of drug can be decided by tolerability and blood-pressure response rather than long-term safety or efficacy."
Effect of amlodipine on the progression of atherosclerosis and the occurrence of clinical events. PREVENT Investigators.,"The results of angiographic studies have suggested that calcium channel-blocking agents may prevent new coronary lesion formation, the progression of minimal lesions, or both. The Prospective Randomized Evaluation of the Vascular Effects of Norvasc Trial (PREVENT) was a multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-masked clinical trial designed to test whether amlodipine would slow the progression of early coronary atherosclerosis in 825 patients with angiographically documented coronary artery disease. The primary outcome was the average 36-month angiographic change in mean minimal diameters of segments with a baseline diameter stenosis of 30%. A secondary hypothesis was whether amlodipine would reduce the rate of atherosclerosis in the carotid arteries as assessed with B-mode ultrasonography, which measured intimal-medial thicknesses (IMT). The rates of clinical events were also monitored. The placebo and amlodipine groups had nearly identical average 36-month reductions in the minimal diameter: 0.084 versus 0.095 mm, respectively (P:=0.38). In contrast, amlodipine had a significant effect in slowing the 36-month progression of carotid artery atherosclerosis: the placebo group experienced a 0.033-mm increase in IMT, whereas there was a 0. 0126-mm decrease in the amlodipine group (P:=0.007). There was no treatment difference in the rates of all-cause mortality or major cardiovascular events, although amlodipine use was associated with fewer cases of unstable angina and coronary revascularization. Amlodipine has no demonstrable effect on angiographic progression of coronary atherosclerosis or the risk of major cardiovascular events but is associated with fewer hospitalizations for unstable angina and revascularization."
Monotherapy with amlodipine or atenolol versus their combination in stable angina pectoris.,"The basic cause of angina pectoris is imbalance between the metabolic needs of the myocardium and the capacity of the coronary circulation to deliver sufficient oxygenated blood to satisfy these needs. The study was undertaken to evaluate whether the effect of combined amlodipine and atenolol therapy on patients with stable angina pectoris and with ST-depression during exercise testing and 48-h ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring is superior to that of either agent given alone. Patients with stable angina pectoris and ST depression during exercise and ambulatory monitoring were randomized to receive amlodipine (n = 116) or atenolol (n = 116), or both (n = 119). All patients were also treated with short- and long-acting nitrates. The design was a double-blind, randomized, triple-arm parallel group study with 10 weeks of administration of the test medication. In terms of time to onset of ST depression > 1 mm, time to onset of angina, total exercise time, maximum achieved workload, and peak intensity of angina, amlodipine and atenolol alone were as effective as their combination. During ambulatory monitoring, atenolol was more effective than amlodipine regarding total time and number of ST-depression episodes, and as effective as the combined drugs. For individual patients with stable angina pectoris, combination of a beta blocker with a calcium antagonist is not necessarily more effective than either drug given alone."
Rhythm or rate control in atrial fibrillation--Pharmacological Intervention in Atrial Fibrillation (PIAF): a randomised trial.,"Atrial fibrillation is the most commonly encountered sustained cardiac arrhythmia. Restoration and maintenance of sinus rhythm is believed by many physicians to be superior to rate control only. However, there are no prospective data that compare both therapeutic strategies. The Pharmacological Intervention in Atrial Fibrillation (PIAF) trial was a randomised trial in 252 patients with atrial fibrillation of between 7 days and 360 days duration, which compared rate (group A, 125 patients) with rhythm control (group B, 127 patients). In group A, diltiazem was used as first-line therapy and amiodarone was used in group B. The primary study endpoint was improvement in symptoms related to atrial fibrillation. Over the entire observation period of 1 year, a similar proportion of patients reported improvement in symptoms in both groups (76 responders at 12 months in group A vs 70 responders in group B, p=0.317). Amiodarone administration resulted in pharmacological restoration of sinus rhythm in 23% of patients. Walking distance in a 6 min walk test was better in group B compared with group A, but assessment of quality of life showed no differences between groups. The incidence of hospital admission was higher in group B (87 [69%] out of 127 vs 30 [24%] out of 125 in group A, p=0.001). Adverse drug effects more frequently led to a change in therapy in group B (31 [25%] patients compared with 17 [14%] in group A, p=0.036). With respect to symptomatic improvement in patients with atrial fibrillation, the therapeutic strategies of rate versus rhythm control yielded similar clinical results overall. However, exercise tolerance is better with rhythm control, although hospital admission is more frequent. These data may serve as a basis to select therapy in individual patients."
Health outcomes associated with calcium antagonists compared with other first-line antihypertensive therapies: a meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials.,"Several observational studies and individual randomised trials in hypertension have suggested that, compared with other drugs, calcium antagonists may be associated with a higher risk of coronary events, despite similar blood-pressure control. The aim of this meta-analysis was to compare the effects of calcium antagonists and other antihypertensive drugs on major cardiovascular events. We undertook a meta-analysis of trials in hypertension that assessed cardiovascular events and included at least 100 patients, who were randomly assigned intermediate-acting or long-acting calcium antagonists or other antihypertensive drugs and who were followed up for at least 2 years. The nine eligible trials included 27,743 participants. Calcium antagonists and other drugs achieved similar control of both systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Compared with patients assigned diuretics, beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors, or clonidine (n=15,044), those assigned calcium antagonists (n=12,699) had a significantly higher risk of acute myocardial infarction (odds ratio 1.26 [95% CI 1.11-1.43], p=0.0003), congestive heart failure (1.25 [1.07-1.46], p=0.005), and major cardiovascular events (1.10 [1.02-1.18], p=0.018). The treatment differences were within the play of chance for the outcomes of stroke (0.90 [0.80-1.02], p=0.10) and all-cause mortality (1.03 [0.94-1.13], p=0.54). In randomised controlled trials, the large available database suggests that calcium antagonists are inferior to other types of antihypertensive drugs as first-line agents in reducing the risks of several major complications of hypertension. On the basis of these data, the longer-acting calcium antagonists cannot be recommended as first-line therapy for hypertension."
"Effects of ACE inhibitors, calcium antagonists, and other blood-pressure-lowering drugs: results of prospectively designed overviews of randomised trials. Blood Pressure Lowering Treatment Trialists' Collaboration.","This programme of overviews of randomised trials was established to investigate the effects of angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, calcium antagonists, and other blood-pressure-lowering drugs on mortality and major cardiovascular morbidity in several populations of patients. We did separate overviews of trials comparing active treatment regimens with placebo, trials comparing more intensive and less intensive blood-pressure-lowering strategies, and trials comparing treatment regimens based on different drug classes. The hypotheses to be investigated, the trials to be included, and the outcomes to be studied were all selected before the results of any participating trial were known. Individual participant data or group tabular data were provided by each trial and combined by standard statistical techniques. The overview of placebo-controlled trials of ACE inhibitors (four trials, 12,124 patients mostly with coronary heart disease) revealed reductions in stroke (30% [95% CI 15-43]), coronary heart disease (20% [11-28]), and major cardiovascular events (21% [14-27]). The overview of placebo-controlled trials of calcium antagonists (two trials, 5520 patients mostly with hypertension) showed reductions in stroke (39% [15-56]) and major cardiovascular events (28% [13-41]). In the overview of trials comparing blood-pressure-lowering strategies of different intensity (three trials, 20,408 patients with hypertension), there were reduced risks of stroke (20% [2-35]), coronary heart disease (19% [2-33]), and major cardiovascular events (15% [4-24]) with more intensive therapy. In the overviews comparing different antihypertensive regimens (eight trials, 37,872 patients with hypertension), several differences in cause-specific effects were seen between calcium-antagonist-based therapy and other regimens, but each was of borderline significance. Strong evidence of benefits of ACE inhibitors and calcium antagonists is provided by the overviews of placebo-controlled trials. There is weaker evidence of differences between treatment regimens of differing intensities and of differences between treatment regimens based on different drug classes. Data from continuing trials of blood-pressure-lowering drugs will substantially increase the evidence available about any real differences that might exist between regimens."
Amlodipine versus slow release metoprolol in the treatment of stable exertional angina pectoris (AMSA).,"To compare the effects of amlodipine and slow release metoprolol on subjective symptoms and signs of ischaemia during bicycle ergometric exercise tests in patients with stable angina pectoris. A randomized double-blind comparison of the two drugs in patients with documented coronary disease required to have at least three attacks of angina per week and to perform a symptom-limited exercise test with significant signs of ischaemia in the ECG. Out of 127 patients, 117 completed the study. Both amlodipine and metoprolol significantly increased total exercise time, total workload, time to onset of angina and time to 1 mm ST-depression with no significant differences between the drugs. Amlodipine was significantly more efficient than metoprolol in reducing ST-depression at maximum workload. Diary data revealed no differences in patients' self-rating of drug effects. Judged by suppression of subjective symptoms and performance on exercise tolerance tests amlodipine represents a useful alternative to metoprolol as monotherapy in stable angina pectoris."
Effects of pretreatment with verapamil on early recurrences after electrical cardioversion of persistent atrial fibrillation: a randomised study.,
The risk of limb deficiencies and other congenital abnormalities in children exposed in utero to calcium channel blockers.,"Calcium channel blockers given to pregnant rats have shown an increased prevalence of digital and limb defects and their safety in pregnant women has thus been questioned. We examined the risk of malformations following exposure in utero to calcium channel blockers. We conducted a nationwide case-control study based on the Hungarian Case-Control Surveillance of Congenital Abnormalities and identified 22,865 cases with congenital abnormalities and 31,151 population controls during the period 1980-1996. Data on drug exposure were obtained from official questionnaires and obligatory prenatal care logbooks. Among the cases, 586 mothers (2.6%) had been exposed to calcium channel blockers during pregnancy compared with 907 controls (2.4%). The overall prevalence ratios for 17 congenital abnormalities varied between 1.1 and 1.4, and there was no significant increased risk of limb deficiencies or other congenital abnormalities. Our data did not indicate an increased prevalence of congenital abnormalities in offspring exposed to calcium channel blockers in utero."
Effect of ramipril vs amlodipine on renal outcomes in hypertensive nephrosclerosis: a randomized controlled trial.,"Incidence of end-stage renal disease due to hypertension has increased in recent decades, but the optimal strategy for treatment of hypertension to prevent renal failure is unknown, especially among African Americans. To compare the effects of an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor (ramipril), a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker (amlodipine), and a beta-blocker (metoprolol) on hypertensive renal disease progression. Interim analysis of a randomized, double-blind, 3 x 2 factorial trial conducted in 1094 African Americans aged 18 to 70 years with hypertensive renal disease (glomerular filtration rate [GFR] of 20-65 mL/min per 1.73 m(2)) enrolled between February 1995 and September 1998. This report compares the ramipril and amlodipine groups following discontinuation of the amlodipine intervention in September 2000. Participants were randomly assigned to receive amlodipine, 5 to 10 mg/d (n = 217), ramipril, 2.5 to 10 mg/d (n = 436), or metoprolol, 50 to 200 mg/d (n = 441), with other agents added to achieve 1 of 2 blood pressure goals. The primary outcome measure was the rate of change in GFR; the main secondary outcome was a composite index of the clinical end points of reduction in GFR of more than 50% or 25 mL/min per 1.73 m(2), end-stage renal disease, or death. Among participants with a urinary protein to creatinine ratio of >0.22 (corresponding approximately to proteinuria of more than 300 mg/d), the ramipril group had a 36% (2.02 [SE, 0.74] mL/min per 1.73 m(2)/y) slower mean decline in GFR over 3 years (P =.006) and a 48% reduced risk of the clinical end points vs the amlodipine group (95% confidence interval [CI], 20%-66%). In the entire cohort, there was no significant difference in mean GFR decline from baseline to 3 years between treatment groups (P =.38). However, compared with the amlodipine group, after adjustment for baseline covariates the ramipril group had a 38% reduced risk of clinical end points (95% CI, 13%-56%), a 36% slower mean decline in GFR after 3 months (P =.002), and less proteinuria (P<.001). Ramipril, compared with amlodipine, retards renal disease progression in patients with hypertensive renal disease and proteinuria and may offer benefit to patients without proteinuria."
A randomized and double-blind comparison of isradipine and spirapril as monotherapy and in combination on the decline in renal function in patients with chronic renal failure and hypertension.,"Treatment of hypertension in patients with chronic renal failure has been shown to postpone the decline in renal function. Treatment with an ACE inhibitor has been shown to be superior to conventional antihypertensive treatment, but it is not known how an ACE inhibitor compares to treatment with a calcium channel blocker or to treatment with a combination of these drugs. The aim of the study was to evaluate the rate of decline in GFR in patients with chronic renal failure and hypertension treated with isradipine and spirapril as monotherapy and in combination. Sixty patients with chronic renal failure and hypertension were enrolled in the study. After enrollment, patients were followed prospectively for 6 months in the outpatient clinic on their usual antihypertensive medication, and then randomized to a double-blinded comparison of either spirapril 6 mg daily, isradipine 5 mg daily or spirapril 3 mg and isradipine 2.5 mg daily. After randomization, patients were followed for 21 months or until the need for dialysis. Every 3 months before and 3.5 months after randomization the glomerular filtration rate was measured by 51Cr-EDTA clearance and the effective renal plasma flow evaluated using the renal clearance of paraaminohippuric acid. Blood pressure and the decline in glomerular filtration rate did not differ between the groups before randomization. After randomization, the mean decline in the glomerular filtration rate was -0.32 ml/(min x month x 1.73 m2) in the spirapril group, -0.58 ml/(min x month x 1.73 m2) in the isradipine group and -0.14 ml/(min x month x 1.73 m2) in the combination group (p = 0.38). Twelve patients, 4 in each group, reached end-stage renal failure. No significant difference was found with respect to diastolic (p = 0.10) or systolic blood pressure (p = 0.08) during the treatment period, but a trend towards a better blood pressure control in the combination group was present. During treatment, the rate of decline in renal plasma flow did not differ significantly between the groups (p = 0.09), neither did the changes in filtration fraction (FF) (p = 0.58) nor the mean FF (p = 0.22) during the treatment. Our study indicated differences between the 3 treatment modalities in favor of combined therapy with respect to both the rate of decline in GFR and blood pressure control, but the differences where insignificant. Thus, the treatments might differ, but we were unable to confirm this because of large variation in GFR and small sample size."
"Rationale, design, methods and baseline demography of participants of the Anglo-Scandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial. ASCOT investigators.","To test the primary hypothesis that a newer antihypertensive treatment regimen (calcium channel blocker +/- an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor) is more effective than an older regimen (beta-blocker +/- a diuretic) in the primary prevention of coronary heart disease (CHD). To test a second primary hypothesis that a statin compared with placebo will further protect against CHD endpoints in hypertensive subjects with a total cholesterol < or = 6.5 mmol/l. Prospective, randomized, open, blinded endpoint trial with a double-blinded 2 x 2 factorial component. Patients were recruited mainly from general practices. Men and women aged 40-79 were eligible if their blood pressure was > or = 160 mmHg systolic or > or = 100 mmHg diastolic (untreated) or > or = 140 mmHg systolic or > or = 90 mmHg diastolic (treated) at randomization. Patients received either amlodipine (5/ 10 mg) +/- perindopril (4/8 mg) or atenolol (50/ 100 mg) +/- bendroflumethiazide (1.25/2.5 mg) +K+ with further therapy as required to reach a blood pressure of < or = 140 mmHg systolic and 90 mmHg diastolic. Patients with a total cholesterol of < or = 6.5 mmol/l were further randomized to receive either atorvastatin 10 mg or placebo daily. Non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI) and fatal coronary heart disease (CHD). 19 342 men and women were initially randomized, of these 10297 were also randomized into the lipid-lowering limb. All patients had three or more additional cardiovascular risk factors. The study has 80% power (at the 5% level) to detect a relative difference of 20% in CHD endpoints between the calcium channel blocker-based regimen and the beta-blocker-based regimen. The lipid-lowering limb of the study has 90% power at the 1% level to detect a relative difference of 30% in CHD endpoints between groups."

"Characteristics of 15,314 hypertensive patients at high coronary risk. The VALUE trial. The Valsartan Antihypertensive Long-term Use Evaluation.","Valsartan is an orally active, selective antagonist of the angiotensin II-1 (AT1) receptor developed for the treatment of hypertension. The Valsartan Antihypertensive Long-term Use Evaluation (VALUE) Trial of Cardiovascular Events in Hypertension is a double-blind, randomized prospective, parallel group study designed to compare the effects of valsartan with those of the calcium-antagonist amlodipine on the reduction of cardiac morbidity and mortality. Patients with essential hypertension, aged 50 years and older, and at particularly high risk of coronary events were enrolled. 18,119 patients were screened and 15,314 patients in 31 countries were randomized mainly between January 1998 and December 1999. These hypertensives had a mean blood pressure of 154.7/87.5 mmHg at the time of their randomization to blinded medication. The population comprises both genders (men 57.6%), Caucasians (89.1%), mean age 67.2 years, mean body mass index 28.6 kg/m2, coronary heart disease (45.8%), high cholesterol (33.0%), type 2 diabetes mellitus (31.7%) and smokers (24.0%). More than 92% of the randomized participants had been treated for high blood pressure for at least 6 months when screened for the study. The randomized population is now being treated (goal blood pressure < 140/90 mmHg) in adherence with the protocol until at least 1450 patients experience primary cardiac endpoint defined as clinically evident or aborted myocardial infarction, hospitalization for heart failure or death caused by coronary heart disease."
VERDICT: the Verapamil versus Digoxin Cardioversion Trial: A randomized study on the role of calcium lowering for maintenance of sinus rhythm after cardioversion of persistent atrial fibrillation.,"Many relapses of atrial fibrillation (AF) occur, especially during the first week(s) after electrical cardioversion (ECV). The aim of the present study was to compare in a randomized design the efficacy of verapamil (intracellular calcium lowering) versus digoxin (calcium increasing) for maintenance of sinus rhythm after ECV. Ninety-seven patients with persistent AF were randomized to verapamil (n = 49) or digoxin (n = 48) for 1 month before and 1 month after ECV. The first month after ECV, patients recorded heart rhythm using daily transtelephonic monitoring. No additional antiarrhythmic drugs were given. Of the 97 patients, 43 patients (20 verapamil) underwent ECV per protocol. Median previous AF duration was 18 and 26 days for verapamil and digoxin, respectively. There were no differences in atrial dimensions and underlying heart disease between the two groups. The success rate of ECV was 75% versus 83% (P = NS). After 1 month, 47% versus 53% (P = NS) had recurrence of AF. Median time to recurrence was 5 days (range 0 to 26) versus 8 days (range 2 to 28) (P = NS), respectively. Stand-alone intracellular calcium lowering by verapamil around ECV does not enhance cardioversion outcome."

"Efficacy, tolerability, and impact on quality of life of long-term treatment with manidipine or amlodipine in patients with essential hypertension.","This double-blind, multicenter trial compared antihypertensive efficacy, tolerability, and impact on quality of life of manidipine and amlodipine in patients with mild-to-moderate essential hypertension. Patients were randomly assigned to 48 weeks of once-daily manidipine, 10-20 mg, or amlodipine, 5-10 mg. Patients who did not respond to treatment after 12 weeks were also given enalapril, 10-20 mg, for the study's duration. The main efficacy end point was equivalence in sitting systolic (SiSBP) and diastolic (SiDBP) blood pressure reduction between the two drugs after 8 weeks (per protocol analysis). An intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis was performed in all patients with at least one efficacy determination during treatment. Quality of life was assessed by the ""Subjective Symptoms Assessment Profile"" (SSA-P) and ""General Well-being Schedule"" (GWBS), after 12 weeks of treatment. SiSBP reduction after 8 weeks was equivalent for manidipine (15.2 mm Hg, n = 227) and amlodipine (17.0 mm Hg, n = 219). The corresponding figure for SiDBP was 11.3 mm Hg for manidipine and 12.3 mm Hg for amlodipine. In the larger ITT population SiDBP was similarly and significantly reduced by manidipine (from 102 +/- 5 to 88 +/- 9 mm Hg, n = 241) and amlodipine (from 101 +/- 5 to 87 +/- 8 mm Hg, n = 240). Similar results were observed for SiSBP and standing SBP and DBP. Neither drug changed sitting or standing heart rate compared with baseline. SSA-P scores improved with manidipine but not amlodipine. GWBS total and partial scores increased more with manidipine than with amlodipine. Safety profile favored manidipine, which was associated with significantly less ankle edema than was amlodipine. This study shows for the first time that long-term treatment with the long-acting calcium channel blocker manidipine is as effective as treatment with amlodipine, has a better tolerability profile, and induces greater improvement in quality of life than amlodipine."
A random comparison of fosinopril and nifedipine GITS in patients with primary renal disease.,"To investigate in a random comparison the capacity of an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (fosinopril), and that of a long-acting dihydropiridine (nifedipine GITS) to modify the decay in renal function in patients with primary renal disease, exhibiting a progressive increase in serum creatinine during the previous 2 years. A randomized, open-label, multicenter study with a minimum follow-up of 3 years. A total of 241 patients were included in the study. All of them were hypertensive and had a 25% or at least 0.5 mg/dl increase in the value of serum creatinine during the 24 months prior to entering the study. Initial doses of fosinopril and nifedipine GITS were 10 and 30 mg respectively, and titration to 30 and 60 mg was performed if needed to obtain the expected blood pressure goal (< 140/90 mmHg). Furosemide, atenolol, and doxazosin were added as second, third, and fourth drugs if necessary, for blood pressure control. The primary end-point of the study was the appearance of double the serum creatinine values and/or the need to enter a dialysis programme. Secondary end-points were cardiovascular events, death, changes in 24 h proteinuria, and the evolution of serum creatinine. Data reflect the analysis performed by intention to treat. Mean age of the group was 54 +/- 14, and 59% were males. Primary glomerulonephritis (31%), nephrosclerosis (26%) and polycystic kidney disease (19%) were the three most frequent diagnostic findings. After 3 years of follow-up, 21% (27/127) of patients treated with fosinopril, and 36% (40/112) of those receiving nifedipine GITS presented a primary end-point, (OR 0.47, 95% confidence intervals 0.26-0.84, P = 0.01). Renal survival was significantly better when fosinopril constituted the first step therapy (P = 0.002). These results did not seem to be influenced by the type of primary renal disease. Proteinuria decreased at the end of the study by a mean of 57% in the fosinopril group and increased by 7% in the group receiving dihydropiridine. Blood pressure control did not differ among groups for diastolic values. During follow-up, however, the patients receiving ACEi showed systolic blood pressure values 4-6 mmHg lower. In patients with chronic renal failure and hypertension due to primary renal disease, fosinopril significantly differed from nifedipine GITS by its capacity to slow the progressive decay in renal function. The drugs also differed by their capacity to lower blood pressure. The better control, in particular of systolic blood pressure, in the fosinopril arm could have contributed in a relevant manner to the attainment of a better outcome when the ACEi was employed."
"Efficacy, tolerability and influence on ""quality of life"" of nifedipine GITS versus amlodipine in elderly patients with mild-moderate hypertension.","The main purpose of this study was to compare efficacy, tolerability and influence on quality of life (QOL) of nifedipine gastrointestinal therapeutic system (NI) 30-60 mg once a day vs amlodipine (AM) 5-10 mg once a day in elderly patients with mild-moderate hypertension. This was a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, multicenter study. After a 2-week single-blind placebo run-in, patients were randomized to either NI 30 mg or AM 5 mg. Responders continued on the same dosage for 16 additional weeks, while non-responders were titrated to 60 mg NI or 10 mg AM. Blood pressure was measured by mercury sphygmomanometer and efficacy equivalence of NI and AM tested by covariance analysis. Diastolic blood pressure (DBP) was the primary efficacy parameter, its baseline value being taken as covariate while centers effect and treatment interaction were included as fixed effects in the analysis model. The secondary efficacy variables systolic blood pressure (SBP) and scores for QOL were analyzed according to the same model. At the end of the study, overall mean DBPs, calculated as least-square means (LSMEANS), in the ""by protocol"" population were 87.5 mmHg for NI and 86.7 for AM (difference 0.8 mmHg with 90% CI -1.2 to 2.8 mmHg). In the ""by intention to treat"" (ITT) population LSMEANS were 87.6 mmHg for NI and 86.4 mmHg for AM (difference 1.2 mmHg with 90% CI -0.6 to 3.1 mmHg). SBP LSMEANS in the ""by protocol"" population were 147.7 mmHg for NI and 147.3 mmHg for AM (difference 0.3 mmHg, with 90% CI -3.7 to 4.3); corresponding values in the ""by ITT"" population were 148.0 mmHg for NI and 147.2 for AM (difference 0.8 mmHg, with 90% CI -2.8 to 4.6). Mean values for QOL parameters were not significantly different. A total of 173 episodes of adverse events were documented in 54 patients (26 NI and 28 AM), dropouts were 15 (20% of group) on NI and 21 (28%) on AM. NI 30-60 mg was shown to be as efficacious and safe as AM 5-10 mg in elderly patients with mild-moderate hypertension. QOL improved compared to baseline with no significant difference between the two drugs, thus confirming a positive class effect for calcium antagonists."
One-year study of felodipine or placebo for stage 1 isolated systolic hypertension.,"Asubstantial number of older hypertensive patients have stage 1 isolated systolic hypertension (systolic blood pressure between 140 and 159 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure <90 mm Hg), but there are currently no data showing that drug treatment is effective, safe, and/or beneficial. To compare the effects of active treatment compared with placebo on blood pressure, left ventricular hypertrophy, and quality of life among older stage 1 isolated systolic hypertensive patients, a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, multicenter clinical trial comparing felodipine (2.5, 5, or 10 mg once daily) and matching placebo was performed in 171 patients (49% male, average age 66+/-7 years, with 49% white and 30% Hispanic) with a baseline blood pressure of 149+/-7/83+/-6 mm Hg. During 52 weeks of treatment, patients randomized to active treatment achieved significantly lower blood pressures (137.0+/-11.7/80.2+/-7.6 mm Hg for extended-release felodipine versus 147.5+/-16.0/83.5+/-9.7 mm Hg for placebo, P<0.01 for each), a reduced incidence of left ventricular hypertrophy (7% for extended release felodipine versus 24% for placebo, P<0.04), and improved quality of life (change in Psychological General Well-Being index, 3.0+/-6.8 for extended-release felodipine versus -0.8+/-10.3 for placebo, P<0.01) versus baseline. There were no clinically significant differences between treatments in tolerability or adverse effects. Stage 1 isolated systolic hypertension can be effectively and safely treated pharmacologically. Treatment reduced progression to the higher stages of hypertension, reduced the incidence of left ventricular hypertrophy, and improved an overall measure of the quality of life. Larger and longer studies will be needed to document any long-term reduction in cardiovascular event rates associated with treating stage 1 systolic hypertension."
"A double-blind, parallel-group study of amlodipine versus long-acting nitrate in the management of elderly patients with stable angina.","Ninety-seven elderly patients with stable angina were included in a 28-week, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group comparison of amlodipine 5-10 mg and isosorbide mononitrate 25-50 mg once daily. The total exercise time, as limited by angina, was recorded together with the median incidence per week of angina attacks and glyceryl trinitrate consumption. Safety was assessed by adverse event frequency, measurement of vital signs and laboratory parameters, and quality of life. At the final visit, the total exercise time was significantly greater relative to baseline with amlodipine than isosorbide mononitrate (final/baseline difference: 112.2 vs. 32.2, p = 0.016). There were no statistically significant differences between the groups in relation to the incidence of adverse events. Once daily amlodipine provides significantly better control of stable angina than isosorbide mononitrate in this elderly population."
Evidence-based evaluation of calcium channel blockers for hypertension: equality of mortality and cardiovascular risk relative to conventional therapy.,"OBJECTIVES; We present a meta-analysis based on three recent, substantial, randomized outcome trials and several smaller trials that compared calcium channel blockers (CCBs) with conventional therapy (diuretics or beta-blockers) or with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. There is continuing uncertainty about the safety and efficacy of CCBs in the treatment of hypertension. Previous meta-analyses conflict and suggest that CCBs increase myocardial infarction (MI) or protect from stroke. Standard procedures for meta-analysis were used to analyze three major trials on 21,611 patients and another three lesser studies to a total of 24,322 patients. Calcium channel blockers have a strikingly similar risk of total and cardiovascular mortality and of major cardiovascular events to conventional therapy. Calcium channel blockers give a lower risk of nonfatal stroke (-25%, p = 0.001) and a higher risk of total MI (18%, p = 0.013), chiefly nonfatal (18%). After performing the Bonferroni correction for multiplicity, these p values become 0.004 and 0.052, respectively. When compared with ACE inhibitors in 1,318 diabetic patients, CCBs had a substantially higher risk of nonfatal (relative risk [RR] = 2.259) and total MI (RR = 2.204, confidence interval 1.501 to 3.238; p = 0.001 or 0.004 with Bonferroni correction). Total and cardiovascular mortality rates are similar. To confirm the hypothesis that ACE inhibitors are superior to CCBs in diabetic patients requires more trial data, especially with renal end points. Mortality (total and cardiovascular) and major cardiovascular events with CCBs were apparently similar to those events seen with conventional first-line therapy (diuretics or beta-blockers). Stroke reduction more than balanced increased MI. In diabetics, CCBs may be less safe than ACE inhibitors."
Effect of verapamil in elderly patients with left ventricular diastolic dysfunction as a cause of congestive heart failure.,"Fifteen elderly patients with normal left ventricular (LV) systolic function and New York Heart Association functional class II-III were studied. The effect of verapamil on LV diastolic function was assessed by congestive heart failure (CHF) score, treadmill exercise test, and Doppler echocardiography at baseline, and after each three-month treatment period (placebo or verapamil 120 mg once daily), separated by a one-week washout period before crossover. Blood pressure, heart rate, LV ejection fraction, LV mass, and cardiac output were unaltered by placebo or verapamil. Verapamil treatment significantly improved CHF score at 3 months (3.5 +/- 0.5, p<0.05) compared with baseline (5.6 +/- 0.5) or placebo (5.5 +/- 0.5). The exercise time was similar at baseline (7.4 +/- 1.2 min) and after placebo (7.4 +/- 1.3 min) treatment but significantly (p<0.05) increased after verapamil (8.3 +/- 1.2 min) treatment. The ratio of mitral A wave duration/pulmonary venous atrial systolic reversal duration increased after verapamil (1.11 +/- 0.08) treatment compared with placebo (0.91 +/- 0.07, p<0.05) and baseline (0.89 +/- 0.08) which had similar durations. The isovolumic relaxation time was significantly (p<0.05) decreased from 84 +/- 12 ms at baseline and 86 +/- 13 ms with placebo to 73 +/- 9 ms with verapamil. The results of this study suggest that in elderly patients with Doppler evidence of diastolic dysfunction as the cause of CHF, three months treatment with verapamil can improve CHF, increase exercise tolerance and improve LV diastolic function."
"Influence of age, sex and blood pressure on the principal endpoints of the Nordic Diltiazem (NORDIL) Study.","The aim of the Nordic Diltiazem (NORDIL) Study was to compare patients with essential hypertension receiving calcium-antagonist-based treatment with diltiazem and similar patients receiving conventional diuretic/beta-blocker-based treatment, with respect to cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. To assess the influence of age, sex, severity of hypertension and heart rate on treatment effects, in a sub-analysis. The NORDIL study was prospective, randomized, open and endpoint-blinded. It enrolled, at health centres in Norway and Sweden, 10 881 patients aged 50-74 years who had diastolic blood pressure (DBP) of 100 mmHg or more. Systolic blood pressure (SBP) and DBP were decreased by 20.3/18.7 mmHg in the diltiazem group and by 23.3/18.7 mmHg in the diuretic/beta-blocker group - a significant difference in SBP (P < 0.001). The incidence of the primary endpoint - a composite of cardiovascular death, cerebral stroke and myocardial infarction - was similar for the two treatments. Fatal and non-fatal stroke occurred in 159 patients in the diltiazem group and in 196 patients in the conventional treatment group [relative risk (RR) 0.80, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.65 to 0.99; P = 0.040], whereas there was a non-significant inverse tendency with respect to all myocardial infarction. There were significantly fewer cerebral strokes in patients receiving diltiazem in the subgroups with baseline SBP > 170 mmHg (n = 5420, RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.58 to 0.98; P = 0.032), DBP >/= 105 mmHg (n = 5881, RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.97; P = 0.030) and pulse pressure >/= 66 mmHg (n = 5461, RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.58 to 0.99, P = 0.041), and more myocardial infarctions in those with heart rate less than 74 beats/min (n = 5303, RR 1.13, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.87; P = 0.040). However, the tendencies for fewer strokes and greater incidence of myocardial infarction were present across subgroups when results were analysed for age, sex, severity of hypertension and heart rate, and treatment-subgroup interaction analyses were not statistically significant. Compared with a conventional diuretic/beta-blocker-based antihypertensive regimen, there were additional 25% reductions in stroke in the diltiazem-treated patients with blood pressure or pulse pressure greater than the medians, and an increase in myocardial infarction in those with heart rate less than the median. Such findings may be attributable to chance, but the consistency of, in particular, the stroke findings may also suggest an ability of diltiazem, beyond conventional treatment, to prevent cerebral stroke in hypertensive patients with the greatest cardiovascular risk."
The effects of calcium channel blockers on cardiovascular outcomes: a review of randomised controlled trials.,"The choice of antihypertensive treatment should be guided by evidence of a reduction in the risk of cardiovascular (CV) events and therefore improved long-term outcome. Using pre-determined criteria, ten randomised, controlled trials that assessed the effects of calcium channel blockers (CCBs) on CV events in patients with hypertension were identified. Six of them enrolled a relatively small number (< 1500) of hypertensive patients, whereas four of the studies were much larger (> 4500 patients). The smaller studies produced mixed findings, especially those trials where CCBs were compared with diuretics; this may reflect methodological limitations and the impact of random error. The results from the four larger studies produced a consistent message: long-acting CCBs such as nifedipine, administered in a gastro-intestinal-transport-system (GITS) formulation, nitrendipine and diltiazem, reduce CV morbidity and mortality in hypertensive patients. In the one study that specifically enrolled high-risk hypertensive patients, nifedipine GITS was as effective as diuretic therapy in reducing CV events, and in all four larger studies sub-group analyses showed that the benefits of these CCBs extend to hypertensive patients with diabetes. The available evidence supports the use of these long-acting CCBs as a first-line treatment option in hypertensive patients."

Randomized comparison of T-type versus L-type calcium-channel blockade on exercise duration in stable angina: results of the Posicor Reduction of Ischemia During Exercise (PRIDE) trial.,"Mibefradil is a T-type calcium-channel antagonist and arterial vasodilator with negative chronotropic effects. It is not known if T-type calcium-channel blockade is superior to L-type calcium-channel blockade in patients with stable angina pectoris. A multicenter, randomized, double-blind trial was conducted in patients with documented coronary disease and stable angina to compare a 360 mg dose of diltiazem CD with 100 mg dose of mibefradil. The primary end point was change in time to symptom-limited exercise termination from baseline to 8 weeks. Secondary efficacy parameters included time to onset of persistent ST-segment depression, time to awareness of angina, and change in exercise duration from baseline to 2 and 4 weeks of treatment. A total of 121 patients were randomized to mibefradil and 113 to diltiazem CD. At 8 weeks, the increase in exercise duration was 24.5 seconds greater in the mibefradil group (P =.017; 95% CI 4.4-44.7 seconds). At 8 weeks, time to development of > or =1 mm ST-segment depression was greater by 45.3 seconds (P =.0025; 95% CI 16.2-74.5) with mibefradil, but time to development of angina was not significantly different. T-type calcium-channel antagonism with mibefradil improved treadmill exercise parameters compared with diltiazem in patients with chronic stable angina. Further investigation and development of antagonists of T-type calcium channels with fewer adverse drug interactions is warranted and may be promising in the management of ischemic heart disease."

Effect of blood pressure lowering and antihypertensive drug class on progression of hypertensive kidney disease: results from the AASK trial.,"Hypertension is a leading cause of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in the United States, with no known treatment to prevent progressive declines leading to ESRD. To compare the effects of 2 levels of blood pressure (BP) control and 3 antihypertensive drug classes on glomerular filtration rate (GFR) decline in hypertension. Randomized 3 x 2 factorial trial with enrollment from February 1995 to September 1998. A total of 1094 African Americans aged 18 to 70 years with hypertensive renal disease (GFR, 20-65 mL/min per 1.73 m(2)) were recruited from 21 clinical centers throughout the United States and followed up for 3 to 6.4 years. Participants were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 mean arterial pressure goals, 102 to 107 mm Hg (usual; n = 554) or 92 mm Hg or less (lower; n = 540), and to initial treatment with either a beta-blocker (metoprolol 50-200 mg/d; n = 441), an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ramipril 2.5-10 mg/d; n = 436) or a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker, (amlodipine 5-10 mg/d; n = 217). Open-label agents were added to achieve the assigned BP goals. Rate of change in GFR (GFR slope); clinical composite outcome of reduction in GFR by 50% or more (or > or =25 mL/min per 1.73 m2) from baseline, ESRD, or death. Three primary treatment comparisons were specified: lower vs usual BP goal; ramipril vs metoprolol; and amlodipine vs metoprolol. Achieved BP averaged (SD) 128/78 (12/8) mm Hg in the lower BP group and 141/85 (12/7) mm Hg in the usual BP group. The mean (SE) GFR slope from baseline through 4 years did not differ significantly between the lower BP group (-2.21 [0.17] mL/min per 1.73 m2 per year) and the usual BP group (-1.95 [0.17] mL/min per 1.73 m2 per year; P =.24), and the lower BP goal did not significantly reduce the rate of the clinical composite outcome (risk reduction for lower BP group = 2%; 95% confidence interval [CI], -22% to 21%; P =.85). None of the drug group comparisons showed consistent significant differences in the GFR slope. However, compared with the metoprolol and amlodipine groups, the ramipril group manifested risk reductions in the clinical composite outcome of 22% (95% CI, 1%-38%; P =.04) and 38% (95% CI, 14%-56%; P =.004), respectively. There was no significant difference in the clinical composite outcome between the amlodipine and metoprolol groups. No additional benefit of slowing progression of hypertensive nephrosclerosis was observed with the lower BP goal. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors appear to be more effective than beta-blockers or dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers in slowing GFR decline."
Major outcomes in high-risk hypertensive patients randomized to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or calcium channel blocker vs diuretic: The Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial (ALLHAT).,"Antihypertensive therapy is well established to reduce hypertension-related morbidity and mortality, but the optimal first-step therapy is unknown. To determine whether treatment with a calcium channel blocker or an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor lowers the incidence of coronary heart disease (CHD) or other cardiovascular disease (CVD) events vs treatment with a diuretic. The Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial (ALLHAT), a randomized, double-blind, active-controlled clinical trial conducted from February 1994 through March 2002. A total of 33 357 participants aged 55 years or older with hypertension and at least 1 other CHD risk factor from 623 North American centers. Participants were randomly assigned to receive chlorthalidone, 12.5 to 25 mg/d (n = 15 255); amlodipine, 2.5 to 10 mg/d (n = 9048); or lisinopril, 10 to 40 mg/d (n = 9054) for planned follow-up of approximately 4 to 8 years. The primary outcome was combined fatal CHD or nonfatal myocardial infarction, analyzed by intent-to-treat. Secondary outcomes were all-cause mortality, stroke, combined CHD (primary outcome, coronary revascularization, or angina with hospitalization), and combined CVD (combined CHD, stroke, treated angina without hospitalization, heart failure [HF], and peripheral arterial disease). Mean follow-up was 4.9 years. The primary outcome occurred in 2956 participants, with no difference between treatments. Compared with chlorthalidone (6-year rate, 11.5%), the relative risks (RRs) were 0.98 (95% CI, 0.90-1.07) for amlodipine (6-year rate, 11.3%) and 0.99 (95% CI, 0.91-1.08) for lisinopril (6-year rate, 11.4%). Likewise, all-cause mortality did not differ between groups. Five-year systolic blood pressures were significantly higher in the amlodipine (0.8 mm Hg, P =.03) and lisinopril (2 mm Hg, P<.001) groups compared with chlorthalidone, and 5-year diastolic blood pressure was significantly lower with amlodipine (0.8 mm Hg, P<.001). For amlodipine vs chlorthalidone, secondary outcomes were similar except for a higher 6-year rate of HF with amlodipine (10.2% vs 7.7%; RR, 1.38; 95% CI, 1.25-1.52). For lisinopril vs chlorthalidone, lisinopril had higher 6-year rates of combined CVD (33.3% vs 30.9%; RR, 1.10; 95% CI, 1.05-1.16); stroke (6.3% vs 5.6%; RR, 1.15; 95% CI, 1.02-1.30); and HF (8.7% vs 7.7%; RR, 1.19; 95% CI, 1.07-1.31). Thiazide-type diuretics are superior in preventing 1 or more major forms of CVD and are less expensive. They should be preferred for first-step antihypertensive therapy."
Verapamil is associated with an increased risk of cancer in the elderly: the Rotterdam study.,"The association between the use of calcium channel blockers (CCB) and cancer has received ample attention, but is still controversial. In this study, we have tested the hypothesis that the observed association between CCB and cancer in earlier studies could be explained by residual confounding or by misclassification of exposure because of the use of cross-sectional data on drug use. Data from the Rotterdam Study, a prospective population-based cohort study in the municipal area Ommoord, were used. The study population consisted of a cohort of 3204 participants aged 71 years or older who were followed from a baseline interview in the period 1991-1993 for the occurrence of incident cancer. Data on drug use were gathered at baseline and through the seven community pharmacies which served the Ommoord region during the study period between 1 January 1991 and 1 January 1999. Incident cancer events were gathered from a nationwide registry of hospitalisation data and from a specialised cancer centre in the Rotterdam region. We performed three analyses. First, we followed the method, and adjusted for the same risk factors, as in the earlier studies. In the second analysis, we included all risk factors that were univariately associated with cancer in the Rotterdam Study. In the third analysis, we included exposure to CCBs as time-varying co-variates, while adjusting for potential confounders. The relative risk (RR) of cancer associated with CCB was 1.4 (95% Confidence Interval (CI): 0.9-2.0) in the first analysis and lowered to 1.2 (95% CI: 0.8-1.8) upon adjustment for the different co-variates in the second. In both analyses, however, verapamil was significantly associated with cancer with RRs of 2.1 (95% CI: 1.1-4.0) and 2.0 (1.01-3.9), respectively, whereas no associations were found with the other CCB in this study, i.e. diltiazem and nifedipine. A significantly increased risk of cancer was found for intermediate daily doses of verapamil and diltiazem. Intake of other antihypertensives such as beta-blocking agents, diuretics and ACE-inhibitors was not associated with cancer. In the third analysis with exposure to CCB as time-varying co-variates, the risk increase was non-significant for use of 2 years or less, 1.0 (95% CI: 0.7-1.5), and for use for a cumulative period of more than 2 years, 1.3 (95% CI: 0.8-2.0). However, in all models the hazard ratio was statistically significantly increased for verapamil, but not for diltiazem and nifedipine. On the basis of these analyses, we found no increase in cancer in users of diltiazem and nifedipine, nor in users of other antihypertensives. In line with earlier studies, however, we found an increased risk of cancer in users of verapamil. At variance with the conclusions from several other studies, we think that it is too early to conclude that CCB are not associated with cancer."
Outcomes with nifedipine GITS or Co-amilozide in hypertensive diabetics and nondiabetics in Intervention as a Goal in Hypertension (INSIGHT).,"To investigate the impact of treatment on cardiovascular mortality and morbidity, we assessed outcomes in patients with hypertension and diabetes who received co-amilozide or nifedipine in the International Nifedipine GITS Study: Intervention as a Goal in Hypertension. Participants had to be 55 to 80 years of age, with hypertension (> or =150/95 or > or =160 mm Hg) and at least one additional cardiovascular risk factor. Patients received 30 mg nifedipine once daily or co-amilozide (25 mg hydrochlorothiazide and 2.5 mg amiloride) daily. Doses were doubled if target blood pressures (<140/90 mm Hg) were not achieved. Primary (composite of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, heart failure, and stroke) and secondary outcomes (composite of primary outcomes, including all-cause mortality and death from vascular and nonvascular causes) were assessed by means of intent-to-treat analyses. There was no significant difference in the incidence of primary outcomes between nifedipine-treated and co-amilozide-treated patients with diabetes at baseline (n=1302) (8.3% versus 8.4%; relative risk, 0.99, 95% CI, 0.69 to 1.42; P=1.00). A significant benefit for nifedipine-treated patients was seen for the composite secondary outcome (14.2% versus 18.7%; relative risk, 0.76, 95% CI, 0.59 to 0.97; P=0.03). Among patients without diabetes at baseline (n=5019), there was a significant difference in the incidence of new diabetes (nifedipine 4.3% versus co-amilozide 5.6%, P=0.023). Nifedipine GITS once daily is as effective as diuretic therapy in reducing cardiovascular complications in hypertensive diabetics. Nifedipine-treated patients were also less likely to have diabetes or have secondary events (a composite of all-cause mortality, death from a vascular cause, and death from a nonvascular cause) than co-amilozide recipients. Our results suggest that nifedipine could be considered as first-line therapy for hypertensive diabetics."
Principal results of the Controlled Onset Verapamil Investigation of Cardiovascular End Points (CONVINCE) trial.,"Hypertensive patients are often given a calcium antagonist to reduce cardiovascular disease risk, but the benefit compared with other drug classes is controversial. To determine whether initial therapy with controlled-onset extended-release (COER) verapamil is equivalent to a physician's choice of atenolol or hydrochlorothiazide in preventing cardiovascular disease. Double-blind, randomized clinical trial conducted at 661 centers in 15 countries. A total of 16 602 participants diagnosed as having hypertension and who had 1 or more additional risk factors for cardiovascular disease were enrolled between September 1996 and December 1998 and followed up until December 31, 2000. After a mean of 3 years of follow-up, the sponsor closed the study before unblinding the results. Initially, 8241 participants received 180 mg of COER verapamil and 8361 received either 50 mg of atenolol or 12.5 mg of hydrochlorothiazide. Other drugs (eg, diuretic, beta-blocker, or an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor) could be added in specified sequence if needed. First occurrence of stroke, myocardial infarction, or cardiovascular disease-related death. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure were reduced by 13.6 mm Hg and 7.8 mm Hg for participants assigned to the COER verapamil group and by 13.5 and 7.1 mm Hg for partcipants assigned to the atenolol or hydrochlorothiazide group. There were 364 primary cardiovascular disease-related events that occurred in the COER verapamil group vs 365 in atenolol or hydrochlorothiazide group (hazard ratio [HR], 1.02; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.88-1.18; P =.77). For fatal or nonfatal stroke, the HR was 1.15 (95% CI, 0.90-1.48); for fatal or nonfatal myocardial infarction, 0.82 (95% CI, 0.65-1.03); and for cardiovascular disease-related death, 1.09 (95% CI, 0.87-1.37). The HR was 1.05 (95% CI, 0.95-1.16) for any prespecified cardiovascular disease-related event and 1.08 (95% CI, 0.93-1.26) for all-cause mortality. Nonstroke hemorrhage was more common with participants in the COER-verapamil group (n = 118) compared with the atenolol or hydrochlorothiazide group (n = 79) (HR, 1.54 [95% CI, 1.16-2.04]; P =.003). More cardiovascular disease-related events occurred between 6 AM and noon in both the COER verapamil (99/277) and atenolol or hydrochlorothiazide (88/274) groups; HR, 1.15 (95% CI, 0.86-1.53). The CONVINCE trial did not demonstrate equivalence of a COER verapamil-based antihypertensive regimen compared with a regimen beginning with a diuretic or beta-blocker. When considered in the context of other trials of calcium antagonists, these data indicate that the effectiveness of calcium-channel therapy in reducing cardiovascular disease is similar but not better than diuretic or beta-blocker treatment."
Relation between use of antihypertensive medications and risk of breast carcinoma among women ages 65-79 years.,"Limited data are available regarding the incidence of breast carcinoma among users of relatively recently introduced forms of antihypertensive therapy. Although it has been suggested that women who have taken calcium channel blockers (CCBs) have an increased risk and that women who have taken angiotensin-I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have a decreased risk, currently, no conclusions can be drawn. A population-based case-control study of women ages 65-79 years was conducted in western Washington State. The responses of 975 women who were diagnosed with invasive breast carcinoma during 1997-1999 were compared with the responses of 1007 women in a control group. Associations between use of different types of antihypertensive medications and breast carcinoma incidence were evaluated using logistic regression. Overall, women who had ever used CCBs, beta-blockers, or ACE inhibitors did not have an altered risk of breast carcinoma relative to women who had never used antihypertensive medications. Although the use of immediate-release CCBs, thiazide diuretics, and potassium-sparing diuretics was associated with modestly increased risks of breast carcinoma (odds ratio [OR], 1.5; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.0-2.1; OR, 1.4; 95% CI, 1.1-1.8; and OR, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.2-2.1, respectively), the absence of any trend in the size of excess risk with increasing duration or with current versus former use of these agents argues for a cautious interpretation. The use of particular types of antihypertensive medications, including immediate-release CCBs and certain diuretics, may increase the risk of breast carcinoma among older women. Additional studies are warranted to clarify these potential associations. Cancer 2003;98:1504-13."
A calcium antagonist vs a non-calcium antagonist hypertension treatment strategy for patients with coronary artery disease. The International Verapamil-Trandolapril Study (INVEST): a randomized controlled trial.,"Despite evidence of efficacy of antihypertensive agents in treating hypertensive patients, safety and efficacy of antihypertensive agents for coronary artery disease (CAD) have been discerned only from subgroup analyses in large trials. To compare mortality and morbidity outcomes in patients with hypertension and CAD treated with a calcium antagonist strategy (CAS) or a non-calcium antagonist strategy (NCAS). Randomized, open label, blinded end point study of 22 576 hypertensive CAD patients aged 50 years or older, which was conducted September 1997 to February 2003 at 862 sites in 14 countries. Patients were randomly assigned to either CAS (verapamil sustained release) or NCAS (atenolol). Strategies specified dose and additional drug regimens. Trandolapril and/or hydrochlorothiazide was administered to achieve blood pressure goals according to guidelines from the sixth report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC VI) of less than 140 mm Hg (systolic) and less than 90 mm Hg (diastolic); and less than 130 mm Hg (systolic) and less than 85 mm Hg (diastolic) if diabetes or renal impairment was present. Trandolapril was also recommended for patients with heart failure, diabetes, or renal impairment. Primary: first occurrence of death (all cause), nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke; other: cardiovascular death, angina, adverse experiences, hospitalizations, and blood pressure control at 24 months. At 24 months, in the CAS group, 6391 patients (81.5%) were taking verapamil sustained release; 4934 (62.9%) were taking trandolapril; and 3430 (43.7%) were taking hydrochlorothiazide. In the NCAS group, 6083 patients (77.5%) were taking atenolol; 4733 (60.3%) were taking hydrochlorothiazide; and 4113 (52.4%) were taking trandolapril. After a follow-up of 61 835 patient-years (mean, 2.7 years per patient), 2269 patients had a primary outcome event with no statistically significant difference between treatment strategies (9.93% in CAS and 10.17% in NCAS; relative risk [RR], 0.98; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.90-1.06). Two-year blood pressure control was similar between groups. The JNC VI blood pressure goals were achieved by 65.0% (systolic) and 88.5% (diastolic) of CAS and 64.0% (systolic) and 88.1% (diastolic) of NCAS patients. A total of 71.7% of CAS and 70.7% of NCAS patients achieved a systolic blood pressure of less than 140 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure of less than 90 mm Hg. The verapamil-trandolapril-based strategy was as clinically effective as the atenolol-hydrochlorothiazide-based strategy in hypertensive CAD patients."
"Comparison of effects on peak oxygen consumption, quality of life, and neurohormones of felodipine and enalapril in patients with congestive heart failure.","Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition is currently the cornerstone of congestive heart failure (CHF) therapy, but these drugs are not tolerated in up to 20% of patients. For these patients, therapeutic alternatives with comparable efficacy are needed. Felodipine, a vasoselective dihydropyridine calcium antagonist with a slow onset of action and a long plasma half-life, may be such an agent. Therefore, the efficacy and safety of felodipine were examined and compared with enalapril using a double-blind design. We studied 46 patients with a left ventricular ejection fraction < 0.40, peak oxygen consumption < 20 ml.min-1.kg-1, and symptoms of CHF despite therapy with diuretics and digoxin. After 16 weeks of therapy, there were no statistically significant differences in peak oxygen consumption (felodipine +1.6, enalapril +2.5 ml.min-1.kg-1) and exercise tolerance (felodipine +61 seconds, enalapril +64 seconds). Quality-of-life parameters were affected slightly better by felodipine than by enalapril. Plasma norepinephrine decreased by 143 pg.ml-1 with enalapril and by 12 pg.ml-1 with felodipine (p < 0.20 between groups). Both drugs were generally well tolerated. These data suggest that felodipine and enalapril have comparable effects on exercise parameters in patients with CHF. Neurohumoral activation was not observed with either drug."
Vasodilation-related adverse events in diltiazem and dihydropyridine calcium antagonists studied by prescription-event monitoring.,"The incidence of vasodilation-related events (flushing, headache, dizziness and oedema) was determined in a total of 37,670 patients treated with diltiazem, nicardipine, isradipine or amlodipine and studied by Prescription-Event Monitoring between 1984 and 1991. Event rates are expressed as the percentage of patients who experienced these events during the six months after the first prescription. The rates for all these events with the newer vasoselective dihydropyridines (nicardipine, isradipine and amlodipine) were higher than those with diltiazem. Among the three dihydropyridines, there were large individual differences in the rates. With nicardipine, the frequency of each of the four vasodilation-related events were similar to one another (approximately 3%). With isradipine, the rates were also similar to one another but all were approximately twice those measured in the nicardipine study (approximately 6%). These differences may have been due to confounding factors such as the publicity about adverse drug reactions, the indication for use by individual patients or the doses actually being used at the time the event occurred. With amlodipine, in contrast, the rate for oedema was two to four times larger than the rates for flushing, headache or dizziness."
Low-dose drug combination therapy: an alternative first-line approach to hypertension treatment.,"To investigate the concept that the initial treatment of hypertension with low doses of two antihypertensives that have different modes of action and additive effects may achieve control of blood pressure and minimize the dose-dependent adverse effects seen with conventional monotherapy, a randomized, double-blind parallel group dose-escalation study was conducted. After a 4 to 5 week placebo washout period, 218 men and women with diastolic blood pressure between 95 and 114 mm Hg were randomly allocated to take: amlodipine (2.5 to 10 mg), enalapril (5 to 20 mg), and the low-dose combination of bisoprolol (2.5 to 10 mg) with 6.25 mg of hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ). All drugs were administered once daily, titrated to optimal response, and taken for a total of 12 weeks. Blood pressure was measured 24 hours after dose. The response rates (either a diastolic blood pressure < or = 90 mm Hg or a decrease of diastolic pressure > or = 10 mm Hg) were 71% for bisoprolol-6.25 mg HCTZ, 69% for amlodipine, and 45% for enalapril. The mean decreases in systolic/diastolic blood pressure from baseline were 13.4/10.7, 12.8/10.2, and 7.3/6.6 mm Hg for bisoprolol-6.25 mg HCTZ, amlodipine, and enalapril, respectively. The mean change with enalapril was less than the other drugs (p < 0.01), although the once-daily dosing of enalapril and the maximum dose of 20 mg might not have been optimal for this agent.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
Placebo controlled trial of felodipine in patients with mild to moderate heart failure. UK Study Group.,"To compare the effects of felodipine and placebo in patients with New York Heart Association functional class II or III and stable congestive heart failure despite treatment with an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, diuretic, or digoxin, or any combination of these three drugs. 252 patients were randomised in a double blind, parallel group study after a 2-4 week placebo run-in to oral treatment with either felodipine extended release formulation or placebo 2.5-10 mg twice daily given in addition to existing background medication for a further 12 weeks. Patients aged 18-75 years of either sex with chronic congestive heart failure due to ischaemic heart disease, hypertensive heart disease, or dilated cardiomyopathy with or without secondary mitral insufficiency that was stable during the preceding two months were included in the study. Treadmill exercise tests according to the modified Naughton protocol were performed at baseline, and after six, 11, and 12 weeks of treatment. Signs and symptoms of heart failure were assessed at every visit. Physical examination was performed and left ventricular ejection fraction measured at baseline and after 12 weeks. Mean (SD) baseline exercise test times increased from 434 (162) s and 480 (157) s for felodipine and placebo groups respectively to 541 (217) s and 591 (218) s at 12 weeks or the last visit. The change in exercise from baseline to last visit was 107 (141) s for patients given felodipine and 112 (128) s for those given placebo (P > 0.20). There was also no difference between treatments with respect to the other efficacy variables. There were few deaths in the study (felodipine n = 3, placebo n = 2). More patients who received felodipine were withdrawn from treatment (n = 29) than those who received placebo (n = 17). The most common adverse events of the 54 and 28 cited as reasons for withdrawal in the felodipine and placebo groups respectively were increased need for non-study heart failure treatment (n = 10; 8%)--that is, starting new medication or changes in the dosage of existing treatment for patients given felodipine, and nausea (n = 4; 3%) for those given placebo. Patients withdrawn from the study due to increased need for non-study heart failure treatment rapidly stabilised and recovered. Felodipine has not been shown to be of benefit in patients with mild to moderate heart failure."

Effects of antihypertensive medications on quality of life in elderly hypertensive women.,"The impact of antihypertensive medications on the quality of life of elderly hypertensive women has rarely been systematically evaluated in large clinical trials using drugs from the new generations of pharmaceutic preparations. We carried out a multicenter, randomized double-blind clinical trial with 309 hypertensive women aged 60 to 80 years to assess effects of atenolol, enalapril, and isradipine on measures of quality of life over a 22-week period. The patients had mild to moderate hypertension. Hydrochlorothiazide was added to treatment if monotherapy was inadequate in lowering blood pressure. At the conclusion of the trial the three drug groups did not differ in degree of reduction of diastolic blood pressure or in supplementation with hydrochlorothiazide. Over the 22-week trial, linear trend analysis showed no differences between the treatment groups in change from baseline on quality of life measures of well-being, physical status, emotional status, cognitive functioning, and social role participation. Regarding each of 33 physical side effects over the 22 weeks, we found no general difference between atenolol, enalapril, and isradipine groups on measures of change in distress over symptoms except for enalapril patients who worsened in distress over cough (P = .001) and atenolol patients who worsened in distress over dry mouth (P = .014). Centering on three medications that are relatively new additions to the armamentarium for blood pressure control, the findings underline the increasing opportunities for the physician to select drugs that can control blood pressure while maintaining the quality of life of elderly hypertensive women."
"A long-term, double-blind, comparative study on quality of life during treatment with amlodipine or enalapril in mild or moderate hypertensive patients: a multicentre study.","The efficacy, tolerability and impact on quality of life of amlodipine and enalapril were compared in a multicentre, double-blind, general practice study in 461 mild and moderate hypertensives over a 50-week active treatment period. Amlodipine (5-10 mg, once daily) and enalapril (10-40 mg, once daily) were found to be similarly effective in lowering blood pressure while not adversely affecting quality-of-life parameters. However, 20% of the enalapril group compared with 11% of the amlodipine group required the addition of hydrochlorothiazide for blood pressure control (P < 0.01). Diastolic blood pressure was normalised or reduced by 10 mmHg in 204 (90%) patients on amlodipine and in 190 (85%) patients on enalapril. Side-effects were, in general, mild or of little clinical significance. The major side-effects recorded were class-typical of ACE inhibitors and calcium antagonists, namely cough (enalapril) and oedema (amlodipine), respectively. Tolerability was very good, with only 17 patients (8 amlodipine, 4%; 9 enalapril, 4%) being withdrawn from the study due to side-effects definitely related to treatment. Amlodipine monotherapy produced a slightly beneficial effect on blood lipid concentration, and both drugs reduced the calculated 10-year risk of coronary heart disease. It was concluded that the calcium antagonist amlodipine compared favourably with the ACE inhibitor enalapril in terms of antihypertensive efficacy, tolerability and impact on quality of life."

A randomized comparison of the effect of four antihypertensive monotherapies on the subjective quality of life in previously untreated asymptomatic patients: field trial in general practice. The OCAPI Study Group. Optimiser le Choix d'un Anti-hypertenseur de Première Intention.,"To assess the equivalence of four antihypertensive treatments in patients with mild-to- moderate hypertension, and to compare the effects of those drugs on the subjective quality of life and clinical safety. 653 patients aged > or = 18 years with untreated hypertension were randomly allocated to receive a combination of two diuretics (altizide and spironolactone), a beta-blocker (bisoprolol), a calcium antagonist (verapamil), or an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor (enalapril). Follow-up lasted for 1 year. A composite outcome of the following measures was used to define success: attendance at the 12-month visit; at least nine supine DBP measurements during the study; and median supine DBP < 90 mmHg and a reduction of at least 10 mmHg compared with the baseline value. Failure was defined as one or more of those criteria not being fulfilled. Equivalence was concluded if the 95% confidence interval for the success rates differed between two groups by less than +/- 10%. Clinical safety and subjective quality of life were also assessed. No statistically significant differences in the change in DBP or systolic blood pressure were observed between the groups. The success rates were 43.9, 42.0, 32.5 and 43.9% in diuretic, beta-blocker, calcium antagonist and ACE inhibitor groups, respectively. Equivalence between the treatments could not be concluded, although analysis with a larger equivalence interval showed that some comparisons indicated equivalence. Significant improvement in satisfaction was observed for certain items for subjective quality of life at 1 month in the calcium antagonist treatment group, and significant differences in the responses to the clinical safety questionnaire were observed after 1-month follow-up in calcium antagonist and beta-blocker groups. Differences were no longer significant after 9 months. These results do not provide evidence on the basis of efficacy of blood pressure lowering or ability to increase short-term (1-year) safety and quality of life favouring any particular treatment among the studied drugs for newly diagnosed patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension."
Rationale and design of the third vasodilator-heart failure trial (V-HeFT III): felodipine as adjunctive therapy to enalapril and loop diuretics with or without digoxin in chronic congestive heart failure. V-HeFT III investigators.,"Therapy with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and nonselective vasodilators (hydralazine and isosorbide dinitrate) has become accepted treatment in patients with symptomatic, chronic congestive heart failure (CHF), and has been demonstrated in large clinical trials to ameliorate symptoms, improve exercise performance, and reduce cardiac mortality. Nevertheless, the management of patients with CHF remains a therapeutic challenge. The second Vasodilator-Heart Failure Trial (V-HeFT II) showed that the average 2-year mortality with enalapril (18%) was significantly lower than that with hydralazine-isosorbide dinitrate (25%) but, somewhat surprisingly, the nonspecific vasodilators produced significantly more improvement in exercise performance and left ventricular function. Such data suggest that improvement in symptoms, hemodynamics, and survival may not be afforded by the use of a single class of vasodilator therapy, but might be optimized by the combined use of different agents. This report describes the rationale and design of V-HeFT III, a multicenter, prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial comparing the effects of chronic oral extended-release felodipine (felodipine ER) 2.5 to 5 mg twice daily, when added to a stable regimen of enalapril and loop diuretics, with or without digoxin, on exercise performance, morbidity, and mortality in patients with New York Heart Association functional class II to III CHF followed for a minimum of 12 weeks. Felodipine is a second-generation dihydropyridine calcium antagonist with a high degree of vascular selectivity which, in the doses used in this study, exerts its systemic arterial effect by decreasing peripheral vascular resistance without producing negative inotropic effects. The results of V-HeFT III may shed important light on the role of additive vasodilator therapy in the management of patients with CHF."

Effects of metoprolol vs verapamil in patients with stable angina pectoris. The Angina Prognosis Study in Stockholm (APSIS),"To study long-term treatment effects of metoprolol or verapamil on combined cardiovascular end points and psychological variables in patients with stable angina pectoris. Randomized, double-blind, double-dummy trial. The study included 809 patients under 70 years of age with stable angina pectoris. The mean age of the patients was 59 +/- 7 years and 31% were women. Exclusion criteria were myocardial infarction within the previous 3 years and contraindications to beta-blockers and calcium antagonists. The patients were followed between 6 and 75 months (median 3.4 years and a total of 2887 patient years). The patients were treated with either metoprolol (Seloken ZOC 200 mg o.d.) or verapamil (Isoptin Retard 240 b.i.d.). Acetylsalicylic acid, ACE inhibitors, lipid lowering drugs and long acting nitrates were allowed in the study. Death, non-fatal cardiovascular events including acute myocardial infarction, incapacitating or unstable angina, cerebrovascular or peripheral vascular events. Psychological variables reflecting quality of life i.e. psychosomatic symptoms, sleep disturbances and an evaluation of overall life satisfaction. Combined cardiovascular events did not differ and occurred in 30.8% and 29.3% of metoprolol and verapamil treated patients respectively. Total mortality in metoprolol and verapamil treated patients was 5.4 and 6.2%, respectively. Cardiovascular mortality was 4.7% in both groups. Non-fatal cardiovascular events occurred in 26.1 and 24.3% of metoprolol and verapamil-treated patients, respectively. Psychosomatic symptoms and sleep disturbances were significantly improved in both treatment groups. The magnitudes of change were small and did not differ between treatments. Life satisfaction did not change on either drug. Withdrawals due to side effects occurred in 11.1 and 14.6% respectively. This long term study indicates that both drugs are well tolerated and that no difference was shown on the effect on mortality, cardiovascular end points and measures of quality of life."
Age and severe adverse drug reactions caused by nifedipine and verapamil. Gruppo Italiano di Farmacovigilanza nell' Anziano (GIFA).,"The association of age with risk for severe adverse drug reactions (SADRs) was studied in 2371 and 862 hospitalized patients taking nifedipine and verapamil, respectively. Nifedipine caused hypotension (n = 22), tachycardia (n = 3), and acute renal failure (n = 1) (total SADR rate, 1.1%, 26/2371). Verapamil caused hypotension (n = 3), bradycardia (n = 9), and atrioventricular blocks (n = 2) (total SADR rate, 1.6%, 14/862). The mean age of patients with and without SADRs was for nifedipine 77.1 +/- 1.7 and 71.8 +/- 0.8 years, respectively (p < 0.05), and for verapamil 73.4 +/- 2.9 and 73.1 +/- 0.4 years, respectively. Sex, length of stay, comorbidity, polypharmacy, intake of slow-release preparations, daily dosage, and new intake of calcium antagonists were examined as potential confounders of the age-SADR association. After adjusting for potential confounders, age was significantly and independently associated with SADRs caused by nifedipine, but not with SADRs caused by verapamil (OR = 1.69, 95% CI = 1.05-2.72 and OR = 1.06, 95% CI = 0.63-1.68 for 10-year increase, respectively). Although nifedipine and verapamil did not have significantly different rates of SADRs, an age-related gradient was found only for nifedipine."
Comparison of enalapril versus nifedipine to decrease left ventricular hypertrophy in systemic hypertension (the PRESERVE trial).,"The PRESERVE (Prospective Randomized Enalapril Study Evaluating Regression of Ventricular Enlargement) study is designed to provide a definitive test of the ability of enalapril to achieve greater left ventricular (LV) mass reduction than nifedipine GITs (gastrointestinal treatment system) by a degree that would be prognostically meaningful on a population basis (10 g/m2). To achieve this goal, an ethnically diverse population of 480 men and women with essential hypertension and increased LV mass of screening echocardiography will be enrolled at clinical centers on 4 continents and studied by echocardiography at baseline and after 6 and 12 months' randomized therapy. Blinded readings of echocardiograms at a central laboratory will provide systematic information about treatment effects on LV structure, wall motion, and Doppler blood flow. The study power is at least 90% to test the primary hypotheses that enalapril will induce greater normalization of LV mass and diastolic filling than nifedipine. After the 1-year echocardiographic trial, the study population will be followed 3 more years to test the hypothesis that a reduction in LV mass, independent of blood pressure lowering, is associated with a reduction in the risk of morbid and fatal cardiovascular events."
Does high salt intake cause hyperfiltration in patients with essential hypertension?,"In animal models of salt-dependent hypertension, hyperfiltration is associated with a faster decline in renal function and there is evidence that in hypertensive man, increased creatinine clearance is a marker of early hypertensive nephropathy. We have studied the influence of salt intake on the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) (Creatinine Clearance) in 14 patients with mild hypertension. Each patient was studied in random order and according to a crossover design, at habitual salt intake, at high salt intake (ie habitual +50/100 mmol/day) and at low salt intake (habitual -50/100 mmol/day). Protein, calcium and potassium intake was fixed across the three study periods. The control group was formed by seven healthy subjects. High salt intake, caused a significant (P < 0.01) increase in 24 h mean arterial pressure (MAP) and the expected suppression in plasma renin activity (PRA) and in plasma aldosterone. Seven patients were classified as salt-sensitive. The GFR was significantly higher (P < 0.01) at high salt intake (125 +/- 10 ml/min) than at habitual (113 +/- 7 ml/min) and at low salt intake (97 +/- 6 ml/min). On aggregate urinary salt excretion was significantly related with the GFR (P < 0.01 by correlation analysis for repeated observations) and the slope of this relationship predicted that a 100 mmol/day increase in salt intake is associated with the 14.6 ml/min rise in the GFR. The relationship between GFR and 24 h urinary salt in salt sensitive patients did not differ from that in salt resistant patients. The GFR response to salt loading was largely independent of the renin-aldosterone system. No change in arterial pressure nor in GFR was observed in healthy subjects. At fixed protein intake, changes in salt intake in the physiological range are associated with important GFR variations in mild hypertensives. As long as hyperfiltration in mild hypertension is a predictor of renal function deterioration, high salt intake, independent of the effect of arterial pressure, could be a factor that contributes to nephronic obsolescence in patients with essential hypertension."
Comparative study of efficacy and safety of low-dose diltiazem or betaxolol in combination with digoxin to control ventricular rate in chronic atrial fibrillation: randomized crossover study.,"The combination therapy of low-dose diltiazem or bexatolol with digoxin can be a useful adjunct for achieving heart rate control with minimal side effects. But there has not been a study including patients with impaired left ventricular function and evaluating whether the beneficial effects of medication will be maintained during a follow-up period. The purpose of this study was three-fold: (1) to compare the efficacy of digoxin with low-dose diltiazem and digoxin with low-dose betaxolol on randomized crossover study; (2) to evaluate whether the beneficial effects of medication will be maintained after 7 months; (3) to evaluate the safety of the combination therapy in patients with impaired left ventricular function. We did a prospective randomized crossover study in 35 patients with chronic atrial fibrillation (AF) including 15 patients with left ventricular dysfunction. After enrollment, each patient was evaluated for heart rate, blood pressure, rate-pressure products, maximal exercise tolerance at rest and during symptom-limited treadmill test before medication, at 4 weeks after medication of digoxin (0.125-0.5 mg daily) with diltiazem (90 mg twice daily), and at 4 weeks after digoxin with betaxolol (20 mg once daily). We performed 24-h ambulatory electrocardiogram (ECG) in 15 patients at the end of each phase of treatment. We repeated symptom-limited treadmill test like above method in 15 patients at 7 months of medication. (1) Ventricular rates were significantly reduced in digoxin with low-dose betaxolol therapy at rest and during exercise (67 +/- 3, 135 +/- 5 (mean +/- S.E.M.) beats/min, respectively) in comparison to digoxin with low-dose diltiazem therapy (80 +/- 7, 154 +/- 5) (P < 0.05). (2) Rate-pressure products were significantly less in digoxin with low-dose betaxolol at rest and during exercise (85 +/- 4, 213 +/- 12 x 10(2) mmHg/min) than in digoxin with low-dose diltiazem therapy (105 +/- 6, 269 +/- 12) (P < 0.05). (3) Exercise capacity was significantly improved in digoxin with low-dose betaxolol (9.3 +/- 0.5 METS) or digoxin with low-dose diltiazem (9.7 +/- 0.5) in comparison to control state (8.3 +/- 0.5) (P < 0.05). (4) At 7 months evaluation, there was no significant difference between at 4 weeks and at 7 months. (5) Results on 24-h ambulatory ECG showed the same findings as on treadmill test. (6) Although side effects occurred more frequently in digoxin with low-dose betaxolol therapy, they were minimal and no patient had to withdraw medication. Worsening of left ventricular dysfunction was not observed. Our study suggested that (1) combination therapy of low-dose betaxolol with digoxin was more superior to low-dose diltiazem with digoxin in controlling ventricular rate and reducing rate-pressure products; (2) the effects controlling ventricular rate, reducing rate-pressure products and improving exercise capacity have been well maintained even after 7 months of medication with each combination therapy."
Calcium-channel blockade and incidence of cancer in aged populations.,"Calcium-channel blockers can alter apoptosis, a mechanism for destruction of cancer cells. We examined whether the long-term use of calcium-channel blockers is associated with an increased risk of cancer. Between 1988 and 1992 we carried out a prospective cohort study of 5052 people aged 71 years or more and who lived in three regions of Massachusetts, Iowa, and Connecticut USA. Those taking calcium-channel blockers (n = 451) were compared with all other participants (n = 4601). The incidence of cancer was assessed by survey of hospital discharge diagnoses and causes of death. These outcomes were validated by the cancer registry in the one region where it was available. Demographic variables, disability, cigarette smoking, alcohol consumption, blood pressure, body-mass index, use of other drugs, hospital admissions for other causes, and comorbidity were all assessed as possible confounding factors. The hazard ratio for cancer associated with calcium-channel blockers (1549 person-years, 47 events) compared with those not taking calcium-channel blockers (17225 person-years, 373 events) was 1.72 (95% CI 1.27-2.34, p = 0.0005), after adjustment for confounding factors. A significant dose-response gradient was found. Hazard ratios associated with verapamil, diltiazem, and nifedipine did not differ significantly from each other. The results remained unchanged in community-specific analyses. The association between calcium-channel blockers and cancer was found with most of the common cancers. Calcium-channel blockers were associated with a general increased risk of cancer in the study populations, which suggested a common mechanism. These observational findings should be confirmed by other studies."
Diltiazem improves cardiac function and exercise capacity in patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. Results of the Diltiazem in Dilated Cardiomyopathy Trial.,"Evidence is arising that calcium antagonists in idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (IDC) may have beneficial effects on virus-induced cardiopathology, alcohol toxicity, micro-circulatory disorders, and impaired calcium cycling, all possibly involved in the pathogenesis of the disease. Thus, the effect of adjunct diltiazem (60 to 90 mg TID) on standard treatment was investigated. The Diltiazem in Dilated Cardiomyopathy (DiDi) trial was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial of 186 patients (92 receiving diltiazem, 94 receiving placebo) with IDC diagnosed by coronary angiography, catheterization of the left side of the heart, and a left ventricular ejection fraction of < 0.50 (mean, 0.34 +/- 0.11). The effect of adjunct diltiazem treatment on transplant listing-free survival, hemodynamics, exercise capacity, and subjective status was investigated. During the 24-month study period, 33 patients dropped out of the study; 153 patients finished the study protocol. Twenty-seven patients died or had a listing for heart transplantation: 16 in the placebo group and 11 in the diltiazem group. The transplant listing-free survival rate was 85% for diltiazem and 80% for placebo recipients (P = .444). After 24 months, only diltiazem significantly increased cardiac index at rest (P = .01) and under a workload (P = .02), systolic and diastolic pressures (P = .003 and P = .004), stroke volume index (P = .003), and stroke work index (P = .000) and decreased both pulmonary artery pressure under workload (P = .007) and heart rate (P = .001). Diltiazem also increased exercise capacity (P = .002) and subjective well-being (P = .01). Adverse reactions were minor and evenly distributed in both groups, except for an increase in the PQ interval in the diltiazem group. In patients with IDC, the adjunct therapy of diltiazem improves cardiac function, exercise capacity, and subjective status without deleterious effects on transplant listing-free survival."
"Long-term prevention of atrial fibrillation after coronary artery bypass surgery: comparison of quinidine, verapamil, and amiodarone in maintaining sinus rhythm.","To evaluate the necessity and efficacy of quinidine fumarate, verapimil, or amiodarone prophylaxis for sinus rhythm maintenance in patients who experienced atrial fibrillation after coronary artery bypass surgery. Between 1992 and 1995, this prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled study examined 120 patients in whom atrial fibrillation occurred and was restored to sinus rhythm by pharmacological therapy or direct current cardioversion in the immediately postoperative period after coronary artery by-pass surgery. There were no significant differences in perioperative characteristics among the patients, who were randomly separated into four groups in the course of discharge. In group 1 (n = 30), patients did not receive antiarrhythmic drugs. Quinidine fumarate was given in group 2 (n = 30), verapimil in group 3 (n = 30), and amiodarone in group 4 (n = 30). Patients were monitored six times over a 90-day postoperative period by 24-hour Holter monitoring and routine examination. The recurrent atrial fibrillation usually developed within 15 days of discharge. Atrial fibrillation occurred in one patient (3.33%) in group 1, and two each (6.66%) in groups 2, 3, and 4. Atrial fibrillation was asymptomatic and occurred with slow ventricular response in groups 3 and 4. Side effects occurred in 5 patients (16.6%) given quinidine, 1 patient given amiodarone, but in no patient given verapimil. There were no significant differences in the maintenance of sinus rhythm among the four groups, so we suggest that long-term prevention of atrial fibrillation in patients with coronary artery bypass grafting was not necessary at the postdischarge period."
"Acute hemodynamic and long-term clinical effects of isradipine in patients with coronary artery disease and chronic heart failure. A double-blind, placebo-controlled study.","To assess the acute hemodynamic and long-term clinical effects of isradipine, a calcium antagonist of the dihydropyridine class, we performed a double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel study in 19 patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) and stable chronic heart failure (CHF). Their mean age was 56 +/- 5 years, and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was 0.18 +/- 0.05. Patients were treated with diuretics and digoxin only. All were clinically stable and in sinus rhythm. The acute hemodynamic study showed that (intravenous) isradipine increased cardiac index (+36%) and stroke volume index (+30%) (both P < 0.001), while systemic vascular resistance (-33%) and mean arterial pressure (-10%) decreased (both P < 0.005). Filling pressures and heart rate were not affected. Of the 19 patients, 17 completed the 12 week study; 2 patients on placebo (1 death, 1 side-effects) but no patient on isradipine (5 mg 3 times daily) dropped out. After 12 weeks, peak oxygen consumption (VO2), LVEF, echocardiographic indices, and other clinical parameters were unaffected by treatment. Repeat invasive hemodynamic measurements showed that the initial improvement by isradipine was not present anymore. In conclusion, despite a beneficial acute hemodynamic effect, isradipine has no favorable clinical influence during prolonged treatment in patients with mild to moderate CHF."
Effect of amlodipine on morbidity and mortality in severe chronic heart failure. Prospective Randomized Amlodipine Survival Evaluation Study Group.,"Previous studies have shown that calcium-channel blockers increase morbidity and mortality in patients with chronic heart failure. We studied the effect of a new calcium-channel blocker, amlodipine, in patients with severe chronic heart failure. We randomly assigned 1153 patients with severe chronic heart failure and ejection fractions of less than 30 percent to double-blind treatment with either placebo (582 patients) or amlodipine (571 patients) for 6 to 33 months, while their usual therapy was continued. The randomization was stratified on the basis of whether patients had ischemic or nonischemic causes of heart failure. The primary end point of the study was death from any cause and hospitalization for major cardiovascular events. Primary end points were reached in 42 percent of the placebo group and 39 percent of the amlodipine group, representing a 9 percent reduction in the combined risk of fatal and nonfatal events with amlodipine (95 percent confidence interval, 24 percent reduction to 10 percent increase; P=0.31). A total of 38 percent of the patients in the placebo group died, as compared with 33 percent of those in the amlodipine group, representing a 16 percent reduction in the risk of death with amlodipine (95 percent confidence interval, 31 percent reduction to 2 percent increase; P=0.07). Among patients with ischemic heart disease, there was no difference between the amlodipine and placebo groups in the occurrence of either end point. In contrast, among patients with nonischemic cardiomyopathy, amlodipine reduced the combined risk of fatal and nonfatal events by 31 percent (P=0.04) and decreased the risk of death by 46 percent (P<0.001). Amlodipine did not increase cardiovascular morbidity or mortality in patients with severe heart failure. The possibility that amlodipine prolongs survival in patients with nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy requires further study."
Quality of life in normotensives compared to hypertensive men treated with isradipine or methyldopa as monotherapy or in combination with captopril: the LOMIR-MCT-IL study.,"Quality of life (QOL) measures were assessed in a multi-center, double-blind, case-controlled trial of 1 year's duration. A total of 368 hypertensive male patients were randomly assigned to monotherapies of either isradipine, methyldopa or placebo. If normotension was not achieved, captopril was added. QOL assessments in the hypertensives and in 155 normotensives included a self-structured scale to measure the subjective perception of QOL, the severity, desirability and controllability of recent critical life events, semantic memory, physical dysfunction, sleep disorders, sexual difficulties, depression and work-related stress. The overall withdrawal rate during the trial was 19%, mainly due to lack of efficacy and adverse experiences. At baseline, and at the end of the trial, the normotensives as compared to hypertensive patients, had significantly better scores in most QOL measures. Patients treated with the combination of isradipine and captopril reported more favorable changes in the subjective measure of QOL (P < 0.03) and in semantic memory (P < 0.001) than patients treated with any of the monotherapies or with methyldopa in combination with captopril. There were no statistically significant differences among treatments for changes of other indices of QOL. In most QOL measurements, normotensives rated better then hypertensives. Patients treated on long-term therapy with the combination of isradipine and captopril showed improvement in self-structured QOL measures and semantic memory, compared to patients treated either with methyldopa or placebo."
"Antihypertensive therapy and quality of life. Influence of blood pressure reduction, adverse events, and prior antihypertensive therapy.","Quality of life is an important attribute of antihypertensive therapy. Previous studies have not addressed the importance of a patient's prior pharmacotherapy on quality of life, which may serve as the basis of reference for a new therapy. Nor have previous studies compared commonly used quality of life instruments for consistency, or investigated whether improvement or worsening of quality of life correlates with adverse events or blood pressure reduction. Two hundred eighteen hypertensive patients with diastolic blood pressure (95 to 114 mm Hg) after a 4- to 5-week placebo washout period were enrolled in a randomized double-blind, parallel group dose-escalation trial to compare the effects of amlodipine (2.5 to 10 mg), bisoprolol (2.5 to 10 mg)/hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) 6.25, and enalapril (5 to 20 mg) on blood pressure, adverse events, and quality of life. Three quality of life instruments (General Well-Being Index, Vital Signs Quality of Life, Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale) were administered during original therapy, after placebo washout, and after 12 weeks of optimally titrated clinical trial pharmacotherapy. Our results demonstrated that removal from prior therapy had no detectable influence on subsequent evaluation of quality of life. The three quality of life instruments were consistent with the changes observed with the three therapies: a trend toward better quality of life with amlodipine and bisoprolol/HCTZ. Adverse events, but not systolic or diastolic blood pressure reduction correlated directly with changes in quality of life."
"Felodipine in addition to beta-adrenergic blockade for angina pectoris. a multicentre, randomized, placebo-controlled trial.","The additional efficacy, duration of action and tolerability of felodipine were evaluated in patients with stable angina pectoris and a positive stress test who were already receiving therapy with a beta-adrenergic blocker. One hundred and twenty-eight patients were randomized to double-blind treatment with 5-10 mg felodipine once daily or matching placebo, and were evaluated by serial exercise testing during 12 weeks of treatment. Felodipine at 4 h significantly increased exercise duration assessed after 4 weeks of treatment (increase 34 +/- 65 s vs 18 +/- 71 s in placebo-treated patients; 95% confidence interval 1.01-1.11; P = 0.01), and after 12 weeks of treatment (increase 39 +/- 103 s vs 3 +/- 72 s; 95% confidence interval 1.01-1.16; P = 0.02). The time until onset of exercise-induced anginal pain and time until 1 mm ST depression assessed after 4 weeks of treatment also increased significantly with felodipine compared to placebo. No statistically significant changes in exercise test parameters evaluated 24 h after medication were observed. The addition of felodipine once daily demonstrated a sustained improvement in exercise duration in patients symptomatic despite treatment with a beta-blocker evaluated 4 h after drug intake. At 24 h post dose, no statistically significant effect was observed. Felodipine is well tolerated with a low incidence of side-effects and no adverse effect on quality of life."
Comparison of the therapeutic effects of the beta-blocking agent bisoprolol and the calcium-blocking agent diltiazem in patients with heart failure due to dilated cardiomyopathy.,"Beta-blocking agents reduce mortality and improve symptoms in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). There have been reports that diltiazem, a calcium-blocking agent, is also effective in such patients. We prospectively compared the effects of the beta-blocking agent bisoprolol with those of the calcium-blocking agent diltiazem in 18 patients (11 males and 7 females, age 14 to 68) with DCM. The 18 patients, (10 in New York Heart Association functional class III and 8 in class IV) were randomly assigned to 2 groups. Bisoprolol was administered as the first drug in 10 patients and diltiazem was administered in 8. Cross-over to bisoprolol was also performed in 3 patients. At the end of the study, among the 13 patients who had been given bisoprolol, 9 showed a good response (efficacy rate: 69%). In contrast, only 3 of the 8 patients who received diltiazem showed a good response (efficacy rate: 37.5%). Among the patients in NYHA class III, all 7 (100%) who were treated with bisoprolol responded but only 2 of the 4 (50%) treated with diltiazem responded (p < 0.05). Among the patients in class IV, 2 of 6 (33%) responded to bisoprolol and 1 of 4 (25%) responded to diltiazem (not significant). These results suggest that diltiazem, like bisoprolol, has a beneficial effect in patients with DCM, with a greater effect in class III patients. However, we conclude that diltiazem should usually be used as a second choice to improve heart failure in DCM, and as the first medication only in those with contraindications to beta-blocking agents."
Low dosages of felodipine ER once daily as monotherapy in elderly hypertensive patients: effect on ambulatory blood pressure and quality of life.,"To establish the efficacy of 24-h ambulatory and casual blood pressure (BP) reduction, and the tolerability of once daily felodipine extended release (ER) 2.5 mg and felodipine ER 5 mg as monotherapy. Randomised, double-blind placebo controlled 6 weeks parallel study. From 15 general practices centres (with 19 GPs) in the region of the University of Maastricht, The Netherlands. A total of 129 subjects aged 50-80 years with primary hypertension were screened; 27 men and 61 women with a casual diastolic BP of 100-115 mm Hg and/or a systolic BP of less than 200 mm Hg entered the study. Casual and 24-h ambulatory BP and a subjective symptom assessment (SSA) questionnaire after 6 weeks of therapy. After correlation for placebo response the mean casual systolic/diastolic BP (SBP/DBP) reduction was 10/5 mm Hg (NS) and 12/10 mm Hg (P < 0.05) for felodipine ER 2.5 and 5 mg, respectively. By using 24-h ambulatory BP measurements these reduction were 6/4 mm Hg (NS) and 13/8 mm Hg (P < 0.05), respectively. No significant difference for SBP and DBP was found during the night time between felodipine 2.5 and placebo (-1/0). Felodipine ER 5 mg lowered the BP load significantly during both daytime and night time but felodipine ER 2.5 mg only for DBP during the daytime. There was a significant difference for the number of responders between placebo (28%) vs felodipine ER 2.5 mg (55%) and ER 5.0 mg (59%). Both felodipine dosages and placebo were comparable in (a low) number of adverse events and results of the SSA. During daytime felodipine ER 2.5 mg and 5 mg are effective in BP lowering in elderly hypertensive patients. However, only felodipine ER mg is effective in reducing BP during night time (22.00-7.00). Only felodipine ER 5 mg has a significant reducing effect on BP load during day and night time. Both felodipine ER 2.5 and ER 5.0 have a significant effect on the responder rate. It appeared from this study that compared to placebo, and in contrast with felodipine ER 5 mg, the ER form of felodipine 2.5 mg has no BP lowering effect during night time in elderly patients. To assess the effectivity during night time of felodipine ER 2.5 mg in an individual patient it is recommendable to measure the BP at the end of the dose interval."
Appropriate Blood Pressure Control in NIDDM (ABCD) Trial.,"The ABCD (Appropriate Blood Pressure Control in Diabetes) Trial is a large, prospective, randomized clinical trial of 950 patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) designed to compare the effects of intensive blood pressure control with moderate control on the prevention and progression of diabetic nephropathy, retinopathy, cardiovascular disease, and neuropathy in NIDDM. The secondary objective is to determine equivalency of the effects of a calcium channel blocker (nisoldipine) and an angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor (enalapril) as a first-line antihypertensive agent in the prevention and/or progression of these diabetic vascular complications. The study consists of two study populations aged 40-74 years, 470 hypertensive patients (diastolic blood pressure of > or = 90.0 mmHg at time of randomization) and 480 normotensive patients (diastolic blood pressure of 80.0 mmHg at time of randomization). The study duration is 5 years and is scheduled to end in May of 1998. Patients are randomized to receive either intensive antihypertensive drug therapy or moderate antihypertensive drug therapy. Patients are also randomized to nisoldipine or enalapril, with open-label medications added if further blood pressure control is necessary. The primary outcome measure is glomerular filtration rate as assessed by 24-h creatinine clearance. Secondary outcome measures are urinary albumin excretion, left ventricular hypertrophy, retinopathy, and neuropathy. Cardiovascular morbidity and mortality will also be evaluated. Given the data showing the impact of hypertension on complications in NIDDM, the ABCD Trial is designed to determine if intensive antihypertensive therapy will be more efficacious than moderate antihypertensive therapy on the outcome of diabetic complications in NIDDM."
Cardiac event rates after acute myocardial infarction in patients treated with verapamil and trandolapril versus trandolapril alone. Danish Verapamil Infarction Trial (DAVIT) Study Group.,"Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors improve survival in patients with congestive heart failure (CHF) after an acute myocardial infarction (AMI), but mortality may be as high as 10% to 15% after 1 year. Verapamil prevents cardiac events after an AMI in patients without CHF. We hypothesized that in postinfarct patients with CHF already prescribed diuretics and an ACE inhibitor, additional treatment with verapamil may reduce cardiac event rate. In this multicenter, double-blind study, patients with CHF receiving diuretic treatment were consecutively randomized to treatment with trandolapril 1 mg/day for 1 month and 2 mg/day the following 2 months (n = 49), or to trandolapril as mentioned plus verapamil 240 mg/day for 1 month and 360 mg/day for 2 months (n = 51). Trial medication started 3 to 10 days after AMI. All patients were followed for 3 months. End points in the trandolapril/trandolapril-verapamil groups were death 1/1, reinfarction 7/1, unstable angina 9/3, and readmission for CHF 6/2. The 3-month first cardiac event rate was 35% in trandolapril-treated patients and 14% in trandolapril-verapamil-treated patients (hazard ratio 0.35, 95% confidence interval 0.15 to 0.85, p = 0.015). These data suggest that verapamil reduces cardiac event rates in post-AMI patients with CHF when added to an ACE inhibitor and a diuretic."
Relationships of quality-of-life measures to long-term lifestyle and drug treatment in the Treatment of Mild Hypertension Study.,"To compare 5 antihypertensive drugs and placebo for changes in quality of life (QL). To assess the relationship of lifestyle factors and change in lifestyle factors to QL in participants with stage I diastolic hypertension. The Treatment of Mild Hypertension Study (TOMHS) was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial with minimum participant follow-up of 4 years. It was conducted at 4 hypertension screening and treatment academic centers in the United States. The cohort consisted of 902 men and women with hypertension, aged 45 to 69 years, with diastolic blood pressures less than 100 mm Hg. Informed consent was obtained from each participant after the nature of the procedures had been fully explained. Sustained nutritional-hygienic intervention was administered to all participants to reduce weight, to reduce dietary sodium and alcohol intake, and to increase physical activity. Participants were randomized to take (1) acebutolol (n = 132); (2) amlodipine maleate (n = 131); (3) chlorthalidone (n = 126); (4) doxazosin mesylate (n = 134); (5) enalapril maleate (n = 135); or placebo (n = 234). Changes in 7 QL indexes were assessed based on a 35-item questionnaire: (1) general health; (2) energy or fatigue; (3) mental health; (4) general functioning; (5) satisfaction with physical abilities; (6) social functioning; and (7) social contacts. At baseline, higher QL was associated with older age, more physical activity, lower obesity level, male gender, non-African American race, and higher educational level. Improvements in QL were observed in all randomized groups, including the placebo group during follow-up; greater improvements were observed in the acebutolol and chlorthalidone groups and were evident throughout follow-up. The amount of weight loss, increase in physical activity, and level of attained blood pressure control during follow-up were related to greater improvements in QL. In patients with stage I hypertension, antihypertensive treatment with any of 5 agents used in TOMHS does not impair QL. The diuretic chlorthali-done and the cardioselective beta-blocker acebutolol appear to improve QL the most. Success with lifestyle changes affecting weight loss and increase in physical activity relate to greater improvements in QL and show that these interventions, in addition to contributing to blood pressure control, have positive effects on the general well-being of the individual."
Cancer risk in users of calcium channel blockers.,"Ca2+ channel blockers may cause cancer by inhibiting apoptosis or reducing intracellular Ca2+ in certain tissues. Recent findings suggest that drug users are at increased risk for cancer in general and for colon cancer in particular. We conducted a study in one Danish county of 17911 patients who received at least one prescription of Ca2+ channel blockers between 1 January 1991 and 31 December 1993. The patients were identified from records in the National Health Insurance Program, which refunds part of the price of such drugs. Cancer occurrence and rate were determined by use of the files of the Danish Cancer Registry and compared with county-specific incidence rates for various categories of cancer. During the follow-up period of up to 3 years, 412 cancers were observed among users of Ca2+ channel blockers, compared with 414 expected, to yield an age- and sex-standardized incidence ratio (SIR) of 1.00 (95% confidence interval, 0.90 to 1.10). There was no indication of an excess risk in the subgroup of likely long-term users or users of specific drugs. The SIR of colon cancer, a site of a priori interest, was 0.8 (95% confidence interval, 0.5 to 1.1) on the basis of 34 cases. Although the results are reassuring, the lack of association could reflect the relatively short follow-up after registration in the prescription database. Continued monitoring of cancer risk is planned."
Carvedilol versus verapamil in chronic stable angina: a multicentre trial.,"In a multicentre, double-blind, parallel group study, the anti-anginal and the anti-ischaemic efficacy of 12 weeks of therapy with the vasodilating beta-adrenoceptor-blocker carvedilol 25 mg b.i.d. was compared with verapamil 120 mg t.i.d. During a 2-week placebo run-in period, patients were required to have two treadmill exercise tests (modified Bruce Protocol) differing by not more than 15% with regard to total exercise time (TET). Of 313 patients enrolled, 248 were randomized and 212 completed the study according to the protocol. The primary variable TET was analysed using the Cox Proportional Hazards Model to take into account censored values due to the patient stopping the exercise test for reasons other than angina. Forty-three per cent of patients allocated to carvedilol and 36% to verapamil did not stop with angina at the final visit. There was no difference in the TET between the groups, the risk ratio being 1.14 in favour of carvedilol (90% CI 0.85-1.52). TET increased from 378 s at baseline to 436 s at the final visit in the carvedilol group and from 386 to 438 s in the verapamil group. Results for time to angina and time to 1 mm ST-segment depression were similar. Compared to verapamil, carvedilol significantly reduced HR, systolic BP and rate pressure product at peak exercise. Analysis of 48 h Holter monitor data showed a greater reduction of HR and PVCs with carvedilol. Lown grading improved in both groups. Adverse events were reported by 48% (3.2% serious adverse events) of patients taking carvedilol and 58% (5.7% serious adverse events) taking verapamil. Carvedilol is at least as effective as verapamil in the management of chronic stable angina and demonstrated a favourable adverse event profile."
Safety of nifedipine in patients with hypertension: a meta-analysis.,"Our objective was to compare cardiovascular event rates in patients with mild or moderate hypertension who received nifedipine with active drug controls. We performed a MEDLARS search using the MeSH heading ""hypertension"" and the text word ""nifedipine"" to identify all articles that were published between 1966 and August 1995 in English, French, German, Italian, and Spanish languages and that involved human subjects. The computerized search was supplemented by a manual search of article bibliographies. Review of 1880 citations revealed 98 randomized controlled clinical trials that met protocol criteria. Articles were extracted independently by two doctors who were blinded for author, institution, and treatment regimen, using a structured, pretested extraction form. Differences of opinion were resolved by consensus. Fourteen events occurred in 5198 exposures (0.27%) to nifedipine and 24 events in 5402 exposures (0.44%) to other active drug controls. Unadjusted odds ratios for nifedipine versus controls were 0.49 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.22-1.09) for definitive events (death, nonfatal myocardial infarction or stroke, revascularization procedure) and 0.61 (95% CI, 0.31-1.17) for all events (definitive plus increased angina). The odds ratio for nifedipine monotherapy (sustained- or extended-release in 91% of exposures) was nonsignificantly higher for definitive and all events (odds ratio, 1.40; 95% CI, 0.49-4.03 and odds ratio, 1.39; 95% CI, 0.59-3.32, respectively). The odds ratio for nifedipine in combination with another drug was significantly lower for definitive and all events (odds ratio, 0.09; 95% CI, 0.01-0.66 and odds ratio, 0.15; 95% CI, 0.03-0.65, respectively). Differences in odds ratio for nifedipine monotherapy and combined therapy were statistically significant (P=.02 for definitive events and P=.001 for all events). Results support the safety of sustained- and extended-release nifedipine in the treatment of mild or moderate hypertension when it is used in combination with other drugs."
Effect of the calcium antagonist felodipine as supplementary vasodilator therapy in patients with chronic heart failure treated with enalapril: V-HeFT III. Vasodilator-Heart Failure Trial (V-HeFT) Study Group.,"Despite therapy with diuretics, ACE inhibitors and digoxin morbidity and mortality in heart failure remain high and might respond favorably to an additional vasodilator. Male patients (n=450) with chronic heart failure (cardiac dysfunction and impaired exercise performance) on optimal current therapy (97% enalapril, 89% diuretics) were randomly assigned to double-blind treatment with felodipine extended release (5 mg BID) or placebo for 3 to 39 months (average, 18 months). Felodipine significantly reduced blood pressure and, at 3 months, increased ejection fraction (2.1% versus -0.1% units in the placebo group, P=.001) and reduced plasma atrial natriuretic peptide levels (-2.9 versus 26.9 pg/mL in the placebo group, P=.01) but did not improve exercise tolerance, quality of life, or the need for hospitalization. During long-term follow-up, the favorable effects on ejection fraction and atrial peptide did not persist, but felodipine prevented worsening exercise tolerance and quality of life. In the felodipine and placebo groups, mortality (13.8% versus 12.8%, respectively) and hospitalization (43% versus 42%) rates were similar, and a higher incidence of peripheral edema was the only apparent side effect of felodipine therapy. Felodipine exerts a well-tolerated additional sustained vasodilator effect in patients with heart failure treated with enalapril, but the only possible long-term benefit was a trend for better exercise tolerance and less depression of quality of life in the second year of treatment. The drug appears to be safe but not clearly efficacious in patients with heart failure."
"Rationale, design, and baseline characteristics of the Prospective Randomized Evaluation of the Vascular Effects of Norvasc Trial (PREVENT).","The Prospective Randomized Evaluation of the Vascular Effects of Norvasc Trial is the first angiographic clinical trial to be designed to test whether an agent can slow or even reverse the progression of early coronary atherosclerosis in patients with documented disease. In addition, a subset of patients are undergoing carotid ultrasound examinations, providing a unique opportunity to assess and correlate disease progression in 2 arterial beds."
Risk of serious adverse events in hypertensive patients receiving isradipine: a meta-analysis.,"A meta-analysis was performed to compare the risk of serious adverse events associated with the use of all formulations of isradipine, when used as monotherapy in hypertension, to active drug or placebo controls. Eligible studies totalled 65 published and unpublished randomised controlled trials involving 9903 subjects and 10,675 treatment exposures: 4492 to isradipine, 1473 to isradipine sustained release, 2768 to other active drugs, and 1942 to placebo. Mortality, cardiovascular outcomes, other serious incident illnesses, such as cancer, and withdrawals were sought. Seventy-five per cent of the isradipine exposures were to standard-release formulations and 25% were to sustained-release formulations. Overall, isradipine therapy shows no difference in risk of major adverse events or withdrawals compared to other active controls or placebo (odds ratios [OR] 0.9; 95% CI 0.7-1.46 and 0.5; 95% CI 0.2-1.3). These major adverse events included angina, fatal and non-fatal myocardial infarction, stroke and overall mortality. Isradipine sustained release could be compared only to placebo, based on available data, and shows a lower risk of withdrawals (OR 0.5; 95% CI 0.3-0.9), and a similar trend was observed for major adverse events, (OR 0.8; 95% CI 0.3-2.5). Published and unpublished randomised controlled trials were analysed in separate meta-analyses and later combined when this sensitivity analysis of risk showed no differences between the groups. In conclusion, we find no evidence for increased risk of serious adverse events in patients receiving isradipine as monotherapy for hypertension."
The effect of nisoldipine as compared with enalapril on cardiovascular outcomes in patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes and hypertension.,"It has recently been reported that the use of calcium-channel blockers for hypertension may be associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular complications. Because this issue remains controversial, we studied the incidence of such complications in patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and hypertension who were randomly assigned to treatment with either the calcium-channel blocker nisoldipine or the angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor enalapril as part of a larger study. The Appropriate Blood Pressure Control in Diabetes (ABCD) Trial is a prospective, randomized, blinded trial comparing the effects of moderate control of blood pressure (target diastolic pressure, 80 to 89 mm Hg) with those of intensive control of blood pressure (diastolic pressure, 75 mm Hg) on the incidence and progression of complications of diabetes. The study also compared nisoldipine with enalapril as a first-line antihypertensive agent in terms of the prevention and progression of complications of diabetes. In the current study, we analyzed data on a secondary end point (the incidence of myocardial infarction) in the subgroup of patients in the ABCD Trial who had hypertension. Analysis of the 470 patients in the trial who had hypertension (base-line diastolic blood pressure, > or = 90 mm Hg) showed similar control of blood pressure, blood glucose and lipid concentrations, and smoking behavior in the nisoldipine group (237 patients) and the enalapril group (233 patients) throughout five years of follow-up. Using a multiple logistic-regression model with adjustment for cardiac risk factors, we found that nisoldipine was associated with a higher incidence of fatal and nonfatal myocardial infarctions (a total of 24) than enalapril (total, 4) (risk ratio, 9.5; 95 percent confidence interval, 2.7 to 33.8). In this population of patients with diabetes and hypertension, we found a significantly higher incidence of fatal and nonfatal myocardial infarction among those assigned to therapy with the calcium-channel blocker nisoldipine than among those assigned to receive enalapril. Since our findings are based on a secondary end point, they will require confirmation."
Calcium channel blocking agents and risk of cancer in patients with coronary heart disease. Benzafibrate Infarction Prevention (BIP) Study Research Group.,"This analysis sought to estimate the risk ratio for cancer incidence and cancer-related mortality associated with the use of calcium channel blocking agents (CCBs) in a large group of patients with chronic coronary heart disease (CHD). Recent publications contend that the use of short-acting CCBs may double the risk of cancer incidence and possibly increase mortality in hypertensive patients. Cancer incidence data were obtained for 11,575 patients screened for the Bezafibrate Infarction Prevention (BIP) study, one-half of whom were treated at the time of screening with CCBs, over a mean follow-up period of 2.8 years. Cause-specific mortality was available through September 1996 (mean follow-up 5.2 years). The statistical power of detecting an odds ratio > or = 1.5 (given the cancer incidence rate of 2.1 in the nonusers of CCBs) was 0.91. The power declined to 0.77, 0.54 and 0.41, with declining odds ratios of 1.4, 1.3 and 1.25, respectively. Of 246 incident cancer cases, 129 occurred among the users (2.3%) and 117 among nonusers of CCBs (2.1%). After adjustment for age, gender and smoking, the odds ratio estimates for all cancers combined was 1.07 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.83 to 1.37) for CCB users relative to nonusers. The adjusted risk ratio for all-cause mortality for age, gender and smoking and pertinent prognostic clinical characteristics was estimated at 0.94 (95% CI 0.85 to 1.04). The adjusted risk ratio for cancer-related mortality was 1.03 (95% CI 0.75 to 1.41). Patients with CHD treated with CCBs exhibited a similar risk of cancer incidence and total and cancer-related mortality compared with nonusers of CCBs. This analysis provides a certain assurance that CCB use in middle-aged and elderly patients with CHD is not associated with a meaningful difference in cancer incidence and related mortality."
Calcium channel blockers and the risk of cancer.,"Recent epidemiologic studies have raised the concern that calcium channel blocker use may increase the risk of cancer overall and of several specific cancers. To assess whether calcium channel blocker use increases the risk of cancer overall and of specific cancers. Case-control drug surveillance study based on data collected from 1983 to 1996. Hospitals in Baltimore, Md, New York, NY, and Philadelphia, Pa. A total of 9513 patients aged 40 to 69 years with incident cancer of various sites and 6492 controls aged 40 to 69 years admitted for nonmalignant conditions. Incident cancer overall and 23 specific cancers. Calcium channel blocker use was unrelated to the risk of cancer overall (relative risk [RR], 1.1; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.9-1.3). Use was not significantly associated with increased risks of individual cancers, including those previously implicated, except cancer of the kidney (RR, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.1 -2.7). Recent use, use for 5 or more years, and use of individual calcium channel blocker drugs were also not associated with cancer incidence. Use of beta-blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors was generally unrelated to cancer overall or individual cancers, but both were associated with kidney cancer (RR, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.3-2.5; and RR, 1.9; 95% CI, 1.2-3.0, respectively). The present study suggests that the use of calcium channel blockers is unrelated to an increase in the overall risk of cancer or of individual cancers, except kidney cancer, which has been associated with hypertension or drugs to treat hypertension in previous studies."
Outcome results of the Fosinopril Versus Amlodipine Cardiovascular Events Randomized Trial (FACET) in patients with hypertension and NIDDM.,"ACE inhibitors and calcium antagonists may favorably affect serum lipids and glucose metabolism. The primary aim of the Fosinopril Versus Amlodipine Cardiovascular Events Randomized Trial (FACET) was to compare the effects of fosinopril and amlodipine on serum lipids and diabetes control in NIDDM patients with hypertension. Prospectively defined cardiovascular events were assessed as secondary outcomes. Inclusion criteria included a diagnosis of NIDDM and hypertension (systolic blood pressure of > 140 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure of > 90 mmHg). Exclusion criteria included a history of coronary heart disease or stroke, serum creatinine > 1.5 mg/dl, albuminuria > 40 micrograms/min, and use of lipid-lowering drugs, aspirin, or antihypertensive agents other than beta-blockers or diuretics. A total of 380 hypertensive diabetics were randomly assigned to open-label fosinopril (20 mg/day) or amlodipine (10 mg/day) and followed for up to 3.5 years. If blood pressure was not controlled, the other study drug was added. Both treatments were effective in lowering blood pressure. At the end of follow-up, between the two groups there was no significant difference in total serum cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, HbA1c, fasting serum glucose, or plasma insulin. The patients receiving fosinopril had a significantly lower risk of the combined outcome of acute myocardial infarction, stroke, or hospitalized angina than those receiving amlodipine (14/189 vs. 27/191; hazards ratio = 0.49, 95% CI = 0.26-0.95). Fosinopril and amlodipine had similar effects on biochemical measures, but the patients randomized to fosinopril had a significantly lower risk of major vascular events, compared with the patients randomized to amlodipine."
Value of the addition of amlodipine to atenolol in patients with angina pectoris despite adequate beta blockade.,"Anginal patients who remain symptomatic despite optimally dosed beta blockade may also be given dihydropyridine calcium antagonists. This treatment regimen was examined in a double-blind parallel, randomized, controlled study in 147 patients with angina and positive bicycle exercise tests despite optimal beta blockade with atenolol (heart rate at rest <60 beats/min). Patients were randomized to atenolol and/or placebo (control), and atenolol and/or amlodipine. The main outcome measurement was exercise tolerance after 8 weeks compared with baseline. After 8 weeks, no significant differences in time to 0.1-mV ST-segment depression, time to chest pain, and time to end of exercise were observed. The number of patients with chest pain during exercise decreased significantly in the amlodipine group (p = 0.04 vs controls). The subgroup of patients with an early (<6 minutes) onset of chest pain at baseline showed a significant increase in time to chest pain after amlodipine (p = 0.0001 vs controls). In the amlodipine group, ST depression and rate-pressure product at submaximum comparable workload decreased to 0.4 mm (0.56) (p = 0.03 vs controls) and 1.223 (2.652) beats/ min x mm Hg (p = 0.01 vs controls). The number of patients in each group with adverse events was not different. The addition of amlodipine to the treatment of patients with myocardial ischemia, despite optimal beta blockade, is well tolerated and may lead to improvement in symptomatic anginal patients, who have a rapid onset of exercise-induced ischemia."
Amlodipine versus diltiazem as additional antianginal treatment to atenolol. Centralised European Studies in Angina Research (CESAR) Investigators.,"The antianginal efficacy and tolerability of amlodipine and diltiazem were compared in a double-blind randomized trial of 97 patients with angina resistant to atenolol alone. Both amlodipine and diltiazem significantly reduced the frequency of angina attacks (p <0.001) and glyceryl trinitrate consumption (p <0.05 to p <0.01). During Holter monitoring, both treatments reduced the overall frequency of ambulatory myocardial ischemia, although changes did not reach statistical significance. Exercise test parameters (total exercise time, time to angina, time to ST depression, and maximum ST depression) tended to improve with both treatments, but changes did not achieve statistical significance relative to baseline or to each other. Both drugs were generally well tolerated. Adverse events occurred in 15 patients in the amlodipine group (30%) and in 17 patients in the diltiazem group (36%), but patients taking diltiazem reported almost twice as many adverse events (30) patients taking amlodipine (18). Quality of life, as assessed by total Nottingham Health Profile Scores, was not significantly different between treatments. The addition of either once-daily amlodipine or twice-daily sustained release diltiazem improved symptoms in patients with angina resistant to atenolol alone, but diltiazem was associated with more frequent and more serious adverse events."
Rationale and design for the Controlled ONset Verapamil INvestigation of Cardiovascular Endpoints (CONVINCE) Trial.,"The Controlled ONset Verapamil INvestigation of Cardiovascular Endpoints (CONVINCE) Trial is a randomized, prospective, double-blind, parallel-group, two-arm, actively controlled, multicenter, international 5-year clinical trial involving 15,000 patients. CONVINCE will compare the incidence of fatal or nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI), fatal or nonfatal stroke, or cardiovascular-disease-related death in two antihypertensive treatment regimens. One treatment arm begins with controlled onset-extended release (COER)-verapamil, which has its major antihypertensive effect 6-12 hours after administration. The other arm (standard of care (SOC)) begins with either hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) or atenolol, one of which is preselected by the investigator for an individual patient prior to randomization. Secondary objectives include comparisons of the regimens for each of the components of the primary endpoint (separately), death or hospitalization related to cardiovascular disease, efficacy in lowering blood pressure to goal, primary events occurring between 6 am and noon, all-cause mortality, withdrawals from blinded therapy, cancer, and hospitalizations due to bleeding. Patients may be enrolled if they are hypertensive and at least 55 years of age and have an established second risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Initial medications include COER-verapamil (180 mg/d), HCTZ (12.5 mg/d), or atenolol (50 mg/d). Initial doses are doubled if blood pressure (BP) does not reach goal (systolic BP < 140 mm and diastolic BP < 90 mm Hg). If BP is not controlled by the higher dose of the initial medication, HCTZ is added to COER-verapamil, or the SOC choice not initially selected is added in the SOC arm. An ACE-inhibitor is recommended (although nearly any open-label medication is allowed) as the third step for patients whose BP is not adequately controlled or who have a contraindication to one of the two SOC medications. Patients take two sets of tablets daily, one in the morning and one in the evening. Although most patients switch from an established antihypertensive medication to randomized treatment, untreated patients with stages I-III hypertension (SBP between 140 and 190 or DBP between 90 and 110 mm Hg) are eligible. Outcomes are monitored by an independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board. Enrollment began during the third quarter of 1996, and follow-up is to be completed in the third quarter of 2002."
Effect of amlodipine on mode of death among patients with advanced heart failure in the PRAISE trial. Prospective Randomized Amlodipine Survival Evaluation.,"Investigations of calcium antagonists in patients with advanced heart failure have raised concern over an increased risk of worsening heart failure and heart failure deaths. We assessed the effect of amlodipine on cause-specific mortality in such patients enrolled in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. In total, 1,153 patients in New York Heart Association class IIIb or IV heart failure were randomized to receive amlodipine or placebo, along with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, diuretics, and digitalis. Over a median 14.5 months of follow-up, 413 patients died. Cardiovascular deaths accounted for 89% of fatalities, 50% of which were sudden deaths and 45% of which were due to pump failure, with fewer attributed to myocardial infarction (3.3%) or other cardiovascular causes (1.6%). Amlodipine treatment resulted in a greater relative reduction in sudden deaths (21%) than in pump failure deaths (6.6%) overall. When patients were classified by etiology of heart failure (ischemic or nonischemic), cause-specific mortality did not differ significantly between treatment groups in the ischemic stratum. In the nonischemic stratum, however, sudden deaths and pump failure deaths were reduced by 38% and 45%, respectively, with amlodipine. Thus, when added to digitalis, diuretics, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in patients with advanced heart failure, amlodipine appears to have no effect on cause-specific mortality in ischemic cardiomyopathy, but both pump failure and sudden deaths appear to be decreased in nonischemic heart failure patients treated with amlodipine."
Rationale and design of the International Verapamil SR/Trandolapril Study (INVEST): an Internet-based randomized trial in coronary artery disease patients with hypertension.,"The primary objective of the International Verapamil SR/Trandolapril Study (INVEST) is to compare the risk for adverse outcomes (all-cause mortality, nonfatal myocardial infarction [MI] or nonfatal stroke) in hypertensive patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) treated with either a calcium antagonist-based or a noncalcium antagonist-based strategy. Treatment recommendations for hypertension include initial therapy with a diuretic or beta-adrenergic blocking agent, for which reductions in morbidity and mortality are documented from randomized trials but are less than expected from epidemiologic data. For this reason, recent attention has focused on calcium antagonists or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. While these agents reduce blood pressure, outcome data from large randomized trials are lacking, but some case-control data, dominated by short-acting dihydropyridines, suggest an increased risk of cardiovascular events. These studies had methodologic limitations and did not differentiate among calcium antagonist types and formulations. Several studies differentiating among calcium antagonist types and an overview of published randomized trials show no increased risk with verapamil and suggestion for benefit in CAD patients. A total of 27,000 CAD patients with hypertension will be randomized at 1,500 primary care sites to receive either a calcium antagonist-based (verapamil) or beta-blocker/diuretic-based (atenolol/hydrochlorothiazide) antihypertensive care strategy. The study uses a novel, electronic ""paper-less"" system for direct on-screen data entry, randomization and drug distribution from a mail pharmacy linked to the coordination center via the Internet. Contract negotiations with the United States and international sites are ongoing. Patients being enrolled are predominantly elderly (72% aged 60 years or older) men (54%), with either an abnormal coronary angiogram or prior MI (71%). In addition to hypertension, CAD and elderly age, most patients (89%) have one or more associated conditions (diabetes, dyslipidemia, smoking, cerebral or peripheral vascular disease, etc.) contributing to increased risk for adverse outcome. While 26% have diabetes, most of these are noninsulin dependent. Using the protocol strategies, target blood pressures (according to JNC VI) have been reached in 58% at the fourth visit, and as expected most (89%) are requiring multiple antihypertensive drugs. The design and baseline characteristics of the initial patients recruited for a prospective, randomized, international, multicenter study comparing two therapeutic strategies to control hypertension in CAD patients are described."
"Modulation of ventricular rate in permanent atrial fibrillation: randomized, crossover study of the effects of slow-release formulations of gallopamil, diltiazem, or verapamil.","The management of permanent atrial fibrillation (PAF) consists primarily of long-term anticoagulation with either aspirin or warfarin to prevent systemic embolization, and modulation of ventricular rate (VR) to improve cardiac function by prolonging the ventricular diastolic filling time. The effects of slow-release formulations of gallopamil (100 mg b.i.d.), diltiazem (120 mg b.i.d.), or verapamil (120 mg b.i.d.) on VR were evaluated in 18 patients with PAF without organic heart disease. In all patients, each treatment was administered randomly, was compared with oral digoxin, and was assessed by 24-h Holter monitoring during daily life and by a 6-min walking test. There were no significant differences in mean and minimum VR recorded during 24-h Holter monitoring among the four treatments. Peak heart rates recorded during the 6-min walking test with digoxin treatment was 167 +/- 12 beats/min. This was significantly reduced by gallopamil (149 +/- 23 beats/min, p = 0.01), diltiazem (142 +/- 24 beats/min, p < 0.001), and verapamil (137 +/- 30 beats/min, p < 0.001). There were no significant differences in peak VR during the walking test among the three calcium antagonists. Pauses of > 3 s were observed in 3 of 18 (17%) patients who received digoxin (max 3.4 s) and in 5 of 18 (28%) patients who received diltiazem (max 3.4 s); p = NS. Periods of bradycardia < 30 beats/min were observed in 5 of 18 (28%) patients during digoxin treatment, and in 3 of 18 (17%) patients during treatment with gallopamil, diltiazem, and verapamil; p = NS. Gallopamil, diltiazem, or verapamil are superior to digoxin in controlling VR during mild exercise in patients with PAF without organic heart disease. The reduction of peak VR is obtainable without further slowing of resting VR. However, gallopamil appears to be the least effective calcium blocker at controlling resting and exercise VR; thus, there are no advantages over the other calcium blockers in its use in the clinical setting."
Quality of life and calcium channel blockade with nifedipine GITS versus amlodipine in hypertensive patients in Spain. Gastrointestinal Therapeutic System.,"Compliance with hypertension treatment is affected by treatment-related factors (complexity, side effects), efficacy and compound-specific effects that impact on quality of life. This study examined the differences in quality of life produced by two once-daily calcium channel blockers using different delivery systems: nifedipine gastrointestinal therapeutic system (GITS) and amlodipine. This was a double-blind, double-dummy, randomized clinical trial comparing nifedipine GITS (30 mg) and amlodipine (5 mg) for 24 weeks following a placebo run-in. Clinical, laboratory evaluations and quality-of-life data were assessed at screening, baseline randomization and three times during active therapy. The study was conducted in 13 medical clinics in Spain. The sample comprised 430 screened and 356 randomized patients with mild to moderate hypertension (diastolic blood pressure 95-114 mmHg). Change in systolic and diastolic blood pressure and in health-related quality of life were the main outcome measures. There were no significant differences between active treatment groups in the blood pressure changes (systolic blood pressure: nifedipine GITS -15.5 mmHg; amlodipine -15.7 mmHg). Spontaneous adverse events consistent with calcium channel blockage were not different. The nifedipine GITS group improved in all quality-of-life measures except Sexual Symptom Distress and showed a significantly greater improvement than amlodipine in overall Quality of Life (P< 0.05), General Perceived Health (P < 0.026) and its subscale Vitality (P < 0.019). The amlodipine group declined in overall Quality of Life, General Perceived Health, Vitality and Sleep Disturbance, and significantly in Sexual Symptom Distress (P < 0.045). However, this group improved in self-reported Cognitive Functioning (P=0.036), Mental Acuity (P < 0.005) and Detachment/disorientation (P=0.01). These results suggest compound-specific effects on quality of life that may be due to differences in the delivery system. Nifedipine GITS is short-acting (2 h half-life) and is delivered continuously over a 24 h period, while amlodipine has a half-life of 40 h, which may produce more sustained low-level effects. While a more beneficial profile was observed for nifedipine, amlodipine demonstrated potential positive effects on cognitive functioning."
Safety of nifedipine in angina pectoris: a meta-analysis.,"-Our objective was to compare cardiovascular event rates in patients with stable angina receiving nifedipine as monotherapy or combination therapy and in active drug controls. A MEDLARS search of published articles from 1966 to 1995 in English, French, German, Italian, or Spanish, supplemented by a manual search of bibliographies, identified 60 randomized controlled trials that met protocol criteria. Blinded articles were extracted by 2 physicians. The pooled risks of death, withdrawal, and cardiovascular event were computed and expressed as odds ratios (ORs) for all nifedipine formulations and relative to same study control drug regimens. Thirty cardiovascular events were reported in 2635 nifedipine exposures (1.14%) and 19 events in 2655 other active drug exposures (0.72%). Unadjusted ORs for nifedipine versus controls were 1.40 (95% CI, 0.56 to 3.49) for major events (death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, stroke, revascularization procedure), 1.75 (95% CI, 0.83 to 3.67) for increased angina, and 1.61 (95% CI, 0.91 to 2.87) for all events (major events plus increased angina). Episodes of increased angina were more frequent on immediate-release nifedipine (OR, 4.19 [95% CI, 1.41 to 12.49]) and on nifedipine monotherapy (OR, 2.61 [95% CI, 1.30 to 5.26]). The OR for immediate-release nifedipine was significantly higher than that for sustained-release/extended-release nifedipine (P=0.001), and the OR for nifedipine monotherapy was higher than that for nifedipine combination therapy (P=0.03). Increased risks of cardiovascular events in patients with stable angina on nifedipine were due primarily to more episodes of increased angina, confined to the immediate-release formulation and to nifedipine monotherapy."
Ventricular rate control in chronic atrial fibrillation during daily activity and programmed exercise: a crossover open-label study of five drug regimens.,"We compared the effects of five pharmacologic regimens on the circadian rhythm and exercise-induced changes of ventricular rate (VR) in patients with chronic atrial fibrillation (CAF). Systematic comparison of standardized drug regimens on 24 h VR control in CAF have not been reported. In 12 patients (11 male, 69+/-6 yr) with CAF, the effects on VR by 5 standardized daily regimens: 1) 0.25 mg digoxin, 2) 240 mg diltiazem-CD, 3) 50 mg atenolol, 4) 0.25 mg digoxin + 240 mg diltiazem-CD, and 5) 0.25 mg digoxin + 50 mg atenolol; were studied after 2 week treatment assigned in random order. The VR data were analyzed by ANOVA with repeated measures. The circadian phase differences were evaluated by cosinor analysis. The 24-h mean (+/-SD) values of VR (bpm) were - digoxin: 78.9 +/- 16.3, diltiazem: 80.0+/-15.5, atenolol: 75.9+/-11.7, digoxin + diltiazem: 67.3+/-14.1 and digoxin + atenolol: 65.0+/-9.4. Circadian patterns were significant in each treatment group (p < 0.001). The VR on digoxin + atenolol was significantly lower than that on digoxin (p < 0.0001), diltiazem (p < 0.0002) and atenolol (p < 0.001). The time of peak VR on Holter was significantly delayed with regimens 3 and 5 which included atenolol (p < 0.03). During exercise, digoxin and digoxin + atenolol treatments resulted in the highest and lowest mean VR respectively. The exercise Time-VR plots of all groups were nearly parallel (p = ns). The exercise duration was similar in all treatment groups (p = ns). This study indicates that digoxin and diltiazem, as single agents at the doses tested, are least effective for controlling ventricular rate in atrial fibrillation during daily activity. Digoxin + atenolol produced the most effective rate control reflecting a synergistic effect on the AV node. The data provides a basis for testing the effects of chronic suppression of diurnal fluctuations of VR on left atrial and ventricular function in CAF."
