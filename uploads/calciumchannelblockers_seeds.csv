1217,1218,9973007,Ventricular rate control in chronic atrial fibrillation during daily activity and programmed exercise: a crossover open-label study of five drug regimens.,R Farshi; D Kistner; J S Sarma; J A Longmate; B N Singh,"We compared the effects of five pharmacologic regimens on the circadian rhythm and exercise-induced changes of ventricular rate (VR) in patients with chronic atrial fibrillation (CAF). Systematic comparison of standardized drug regimens on 24 h VR control in CAF have not been reported. In 12 patients (11 male, 69+/-6 yr) with CAF, the effects on VR by 5 standardized daily regimens: 1) 0.25 mg digoxin, 2) 240 mg diltiazem-CD, 3) 50 mg atenolol, 4) 0.25 mg digoxin + 240 mg diltiazem-CD, and 5) 0.25 mg digoxin + 50 mg atenolol; were studied after 2 week treatment assigned in random order. The VR data were analyzed by ANOVA with repeated measures. The circadian phase differences were evaluated by cosinor analysis. The 24-h mean (+/-SD) values of VR (bpm) were - digoxin: 78.9 +/- 16.3, diltiazem: 80.0+/-15.5, atenolol: 75.9+/-11.7, digoxin + diltiazem: 67.3+/-14.1 and digoxin + atenolol: 65.0+/-9.4. Circadian patterns were significant in each treatment group (p < 0.001). The VR on digoxin + atenolol was significantly lower than that on digoxin (p < 0.0001), diltiazem (p < 0.0002) and atenolol (p < 0.001). The time of peak VR on Holter was significantly delayed with regimens 3 and 5 which included atenolol (p < 0.03). During exercise, digoxin and digoxin + atenolol treatments resulted in the highest and lowest mean VR respectively. The exercise Time-VR plots of all groups were nearly parallel (p = ns). The exercise duration was similar in all treatment groups (p = ns). This study indicates that digoxin and diltiazem, as single agents at the doses tested, are least effective for controlling ventricular rate in atrial fibrillation during daily activity. Digoxin + atenolol produced the most effective rate control reflecting a synergistic effect on the AV node. The data provides a basis for testing the effects of chronic suppression of diurnal fluctuations of VR on left atrial and ventricular function in CAF.",1999.0,1,1
1157,1158,9683312,Rationale and design for the Controlled ONset Verapamil INvestigation of Cardiovascular Endpoints (CONVINCE) Trial.,H R Black; W J Elliott; J D Neaton; G Grandits; P Grambsch; R H Grimm; L Hansson; Y LacouciÃ¨re; J Muller; P Sleight; M A Weber; W B White; G Williams; J Wittes; A Zanchetti; T D Fakouhi,"The Controlled ONset Verapamil INvestigation of Cardiovascular Endpoints (CONVINCE) Trial is a randomized, prospective, double-blind, parallel-group, two-arm, actively controlled, multicenter, international 5-year clinical trial involving 15,000 patients. CONVINCE will compare the incidence of fatal or nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI), fatal or nonfatal stroke, or cardiovascular-disease-related death in two antihypertensive treatment regimens. One treatment arm begins with controlled onset-extended release (COER)-verapamil, which has its major antihypertensive effect 6-12 hours after administration. The other arm (standard of care (SOC)) begins with either hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) or atenolol, one of which is preselected by the investigator for an individual patient prior to randomization. Secondary objectives include comparisons of the regimens for each of the components of the primary endpoint (separately), death or hospitalization related to cardiovascular disease, efficacy in lowering blood pressure to goal, primary events occurring between 6 am and noon, all-cause mortality, withdrawals from blinded therapy, cancer, and hospitalizations due to bleeding. Patients may be enrolled if they are hypertensive and at least 55 years of age and have an established second risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Initial medications include COER-verapamil (180 mg/d), HCTZ (12.5 mg/d), or atenolol (50 mg/d). Initial doses are doubled if blood pressure (BP) does not reach goal (systolic BP < 140 mm and diastolic BP < 90 mm Hg). If BP is not controlled by the higher dose of the initial medication, HCTZ is added to COER-verapamil, or the SOC choice not initially selected is added in the SOC arm. An ACE-inhibitor is recommended (although nearly any open-label medication is allowed) as the third step for patients whose BP is not adequately controlled or who have a contraindication to one of the two SOC medications. Patients take two sets of tablets daily, one in the morning and one in the evening. Although most patients switch from an established antihypertensive medication to randomized treatment, untreated patients with stages I-III hypertension (SBP between 140 and 190 or DBP between 90 and 110 mm Hg) are eligible. Outcomes are monitored by an independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board. Enrollment began during the third quarter of 1996, and follow-up is to be completed in the third quarter of 2002.",2001.0,1,1

1108,1109,9486993,The effect of nisoldipine as compared with enalapril on cardiovascular outcomes in patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes and hypertension.,R O Estacio; B W Jeffers; W R Hiatt; S L Biggerstaff; N Gifford; R W Schrier,"It has recently been reported that the use of calcium-channel blockers for hypertension may be associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular complications. Because this issue remains controversial, we studied the incidence of such complications in patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and hypertension who were randomly assigned to treatment with either the calcium-channel blocker nisoldipine or the angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor enalapril as part of a larger study. The Appropriate Blood Pressure Control in Diabetes (ABCD) Trial is a prospective, randomized, blinded trial comparing the effects of moderate control of blood pressure (target diastolic pressure, 80 to 89 mm Hg) with those of intensive control of blood pressure (diastolic pressure, 75 mm Hg) on the incidence and progression of complications of diabetes. The study also compared nisoldipine with enalapril as a first-line antihypertensive agent in terms of the prevention and progression of complications of diabetes. In the current study, we analyzed data on a secondary end point (the incidence of myocardial infarction) in the subgroup of patients in the ABCD Trial who had hypertension. Analysis of the 470 patients in the trial who had hypertension (base-line diastolic blood pressure, > or = 90 mm Hg) showed similar control of blood pressure, blood glucose and lipid concentrations, and smoking behavior in the nisoldipine group (237 patients) and the enalapril group (233 patients) throughout five years of follow-up. Using a multiple logistic-regression model with adjustment for cardiac risk factors, we found that nisoldipine was associated with a higher incidence of fatal and nonfatal myocardial infarctions (a total of 24) than enalapril (total, 4) (risk ratio, 9.5; 95 percent confidence interval, 2.7 to 33.8). In this population of patients with diabetes and hypertension, we found a significantly higher incidence of fatal and nonfatal myocardial infarction among those assigned to therapy with the calcium-channel blocker nisoldipine than among those assigned to receive enalapril. Since our findings are based on a secondary end point, they will require confirmation.",1998.0,1,1
263,264,11467764,"Characteristics of 15,314 hypertensive patients at high coronary risk. The VALUE trial. The Valsartan Antihypertensive Long-term Use Evaluation.",S E Kjeldsen; S Julius; H Brunner; L Hansson; M Henis; S Ekman; J Laragh; G McInnes; B Smith; M Weber; A Zanchetti,"Valsartan is an orally active, selective antagonist of the angiotensin II-1 (AT1) receptor developed for the treatment of hypertension. The Valsartan Antihypertensive Long-term Use Evaluation (VALUE) Trial of Cardiovascular Events in Hypertension is a double-blind, randomized prospective, parallel group study designed to compare the effects of valsartan with those of the calcium-antagonist amlodipine on the reduction of cardiac morbidity and mortality. Patients with essential hypertension, aged 50 years and older, and at particularly high risk of coronary events were enrolled. 18,119 patients were screened and 15,314 patients in 31 countries were randomized mainly between January 1998 and December 1999. These hypertensives had a mean blood pressure of 154.7/87.5 mmHg at the time of their randomization to blinded medication. The population comprises both genders (men 57.6%), Caucasians (89.1%), mean age 67.2 years, mean body mass index 28.6 kg/m2, coronary heart disease (45.8%), high cholesterol (33.0%), type 2 diabetes mellitus (31.7%) and smokers (24.0%). More than 92% of the randomized participants had been treated for high blood pressure for at least 6 months when screened for the study. The randomized population is now being treated (goal blood pressure < 140/90 mmHg) in adherence with the protocol until at least 1450 patients experience primary cardiac endpoint defined as clinically evident or aborted myocardial infarction, hospitalization for heart failure or death caused by coronary heart disease.",2002.0,1,1
265,266,11469424,VERDICT: the Verapamil versus Digoxin Cardioversion Trial: A randomized study on the role of calcium lowering for maintenance of sinus rhythm after cardioversion of persistent atrial fibrillation.,T Van Noord; I C Van Gelder; R G Tieleman; H A Bosker; A E Tuinenburg; C Volkers; N J Veeger; H J Crijns,"Many relapses of atrial fibrillation (AF) occur, especially during the first week(s) after electrical cardioversion (ECV). The aim of the present study was to compare in a randomized design the efficacy of verapamil (intracellular calcium lowering) versus digoxin (calcium increasing) for maintenance of sinus rhythm after ECV. Ninety-seven patients with persistent AF were randomized to verapamil (n = 49) or digoxin (n = 48) for 1 month before and 1 month after ECV. The first month after ECV, patients recorded heart rhythm using daily transtelephonic monitoring. No additional antiarrhythmic drugs were given. Of the 97 patients, 43 patients (20 verapamil) underwent ECV per protocol. Median previous AF duration was 18 and 26 days for verapamil and digoxin, respectively. There were no differences in atrial dimensions and underlying heart disease between the two groups. The success rate of ECV was 75% versus 83% (P = NS). After 1 month, 47% versus 53% (P = NS) had recurrence of AF. Median time to recurrence was 5 days (range 0 to 26) versus 8 days (range 2 to 28) (P = NS), respectively. Stand-alone intracellular calcium lowering by verapamil around ECV does not enhance cardioversion outcome.",2002.0,1,1
116,117,10803490,Progress report on the Nordic diltiazem study (NORDIL): an outcome study in hypertensive patients.,T Hedner,"NORDIL--the Nordic Diltiazem Study (NORDIL)--is a prospective, randomized, open blinded-endpoint (PROBE), multicenter, parallel-group morbidity/mortality outcome study in hypertensive patients designed to compare an intervention strategy based on the calcium antagonist diltiazem with a strategy based on conventional antihypertensive drug treatment (diuretics or beta-adrenergic blockers). Patient recruitment was started in Norway and Sweden in September 1992, and ended on December 15, 1996, when 10.896 male and female patients, aged 50-74 years, with essential hypertension had been randomized. In this paper we describe the baseline data of the patient cohort and blood pressures achieved in the two treatment groups during the early part of the study. The patient cohort consists of 5294 males and 5602 females with a mean age of 59.6 and 60.3 years, respectively. Concomitant disorders and risk factors in the cohort are: smoking 22%, ischemic heart disease 3.0%, previous myocardial infarction (MI) 2.0%, previous stroke 1.5%, diabetes mellitus 7.0%, and renal impairment 0.3%. There were no differences between the treatment groups in these respects. The blood pressure treatment goal is a target diastolic blood pressure of < or =90 mmHg or a 10% diastolic blood pressure reduction from the inclusion pressure. In the treatment group randomized to a diltiazem-based treatment strategy, blood pressure was 174/106 mmHg at baseline and 156/90 mmHg after 12 months of follow-up on active treatment. In the group randomized to a conventional treatment strategy, baseline blood pressure at randomization was 173/106 mmHg and 153/90 mmHg after 12 months on active therapy. The NORDIL study will terminate on October 31, 1999 and the final results should be available by mid-2000.",2000.0,1,1
1117,1118,9525550,Calcium channel blocking agents and risk of cancer in patients with coronary heart disease. Benzafibrate Infarction Prevention (BIP) Study Research Group.,S Braun; V Boyko; S Behar; H Reicher-Reiss; S Laniado; E Kaplinsky; U Goldbourt,"This analysis sought to estimate the risk ratio for cancer incidence and cancer-related mortality associated with the use of calcium channel blocking agents (CCBs) in a large group of patients with chronic coronary heart disease (CHD). Recent publications contend that the use of short-acting CCBs may double the risk of cancer incidence and possibly increase mortality in hypertensive patients. Cancer incidence data were obtained for 11,575 patients screened for the Bezafibrate Infarction Prevention (BIP) study, one-half of whom were treated at the time of screening with CCBs, over a mean follow-up period of 2.8 years. Cause-specific mortality was available through September 1996 (mean follow-up 5.2 years). The statistical power of detecting an odds ratio > or = 1.5 (given the cancer incidence rate of 2.1 in the nonusers of CCBs) was 0.91. The power declined to 0.77, 0.54 and 0.41, with declining odds ratios of 1.4, 1.3 and 1.25, respectively. Of 246 incident cancer cases, 129 occurred among the users (2.3%) and 117 among nonusers of CCBs (2.1%). After adjustment for age, gender and smoking, the odds ratio estimates for all cancers combined was 1.07 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.83 to 1.37) for CCB users relative to nonusers. The adjusted risk ratio for all-cause mortality for age, gender and smoking and pertinent prognostic clinical characteristics was estimated at 0.94 (95% CI 0.85 to 1.04). The adjusted risk ratio for cancer-related mortality was 1.03 (95% CI 0.75 to 1.41). Patients with CHD treated with CCBs exhibited a similar risk of cancer incidence and total and cancer-related mortality compared with nonusers of CCBs. This analysis provides a certain assurance that CCB use in middle-aged and elderly patients with CHD is not associated with a meaningful difference in cancer incidence and related mortality.",1998.0,1,1
1119,1120,9533498,Calcium channel blockers and the risk of cancer.,L Rosenberg; R S Rao; J R Palmer; B L Strom; P D Stolley; A G Zauber; M E Warshauer; S Shapiro,"Recent epidemiologic studies have raised the concern that calcium channel blocker use may increase the risk of cancer overall and of several specific cancers. To assess whether calcium channel blocker use increases the risk of cancer overall and of specific cancers. Case-control drug surveillance study based on data collected from 1983 to 1996. Hospitals in Baltimore, Md, New York, NY, and Philadelphia, Pa. A total of 9513 patients aged 40 to 69 years with incident cancer of various sites and 6492 controls aged 40 to 69 years admitted for nonmalignant conditions. Incident cancer overall and 23 specific cancers. Calcium channel blocker use was unrelated to the risk of cancer overall (relative risk [RR], 1.1; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.9-1.3). Use was not significantly associated with increased risks of individual cancers, including those previously implicated, except cancer of the kidney (RR, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.1 -2.7). Recent use, use for 5 or more years, and use of individual calcium channel blocker drugs were also not associated with cancer incidence. Use of beta-blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors was generally unrelated to cancer overall or individual cancers, but both were associated with kidney cancer (RR, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.3-2.5; and RR, 1.9; 95% CI, 1.2-3.0, respectively). The present study suggests that the use of calcium channel blockers is unrelated to an increase in the overall risk of cancer or of individual cancers, except kidney cancer, which has been associated with hypertension or drugs to treat hypertension in previous studies.",2001.0,1,1
